nilzoroda,2025-02-13 07:07:12,"I think i keepe hearing, at least in many YT reviews, is that the movie feels more like a Incredible Hulk (2008) sequel than a Captain America one."
tbbt11,2025-02-13 06:35:01,"How many more ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, switch off my brain popcorn flick, I‚Äôll watch it on D+, not bad not great‚Äù films can the MCU churn out without completely destroying their brand? Every review thread of MCU films these days is full of these comments"
Latter-Ad6308,2025-02-13 16:31:05,"I watched it earlier today, and will happily add my voice to the endless parade of ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù.  If you‚Äôre a Marvel fan‚Äîand if you‚Äôre here, you almost certainly are‚Äîyou‚Äôll enjoy yourself, but it‚Äôs not one of the greats."
disablednerd,2025-02-13 06:05:25,Tickets are expensive. ‚ÄúJust fine‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough for me to drop the money these days.
Myhtological,2025-02-13 06:02:43,The one from rogerebert says Sam is Ross‚Äô magical black person.
TypeExpert,2025-02-13 06:08:36,"How many more projects with results like this does feige have left before we start asking the uncomfortable questions? Cause now, It's starting to pile up."
T0oShayzz,2025-02-13 11:56:03,"Well, it did not feel good to drop 45 dollars here in Australia to see this movie.... Was really disappointing, felt like it tried to tackle a lot of themes politically and socially but was too scared to fully commit.   5 or 6/10."
Caleb35,2025-02-13 06:01:01,"Not great news but not entirely unexpected, either. Sounds like it's not among the worst of the MCU entries, but solidly in the ""meh"" bracket."
acbadger54,2025-02-13 12:20:57,If thunderbolts is also mediocre I'm gonna lose my fucking shit
0Hyena_Pancakes0,2025-02-13 06:05:34,If it's bad then oh well  I have a feeling Thunderbolts will be really good
Goldwing8,2025-02-13 06:50:14,"Jesus, Robert Daniels‚Äôs review might be the most scathing for a superhero movie since A. O. Scott‚Äôs teardown of Batman v. Superman."
nicolasb51942003,2025-02-13 06:00:36,Why did Marvel thought it was good idea to hire the director who did CloverField Paradox?
Faiqal_x1103,2025-02-13 13:10:12,Oof.. the reviews are NOT looking promising
MattTheSmithers,2025-02-13 22:28:34,"So until ~~Suicide Squad at home~~ Thunderbolts or FF drop, I guess this sub should buckle up for the daily ‚ÄúHot take ‚Äî Brave New World isn‚Äôt that bad!‚Äù posts."
UJ_Reddit,2025-02-13 18:16:53,Not surprised- the story sounds super thin and unoriginal. Which means they need to do the basics really well or it flops.
LRedditor15,2025-02-13 06:26:40,"Something is very wrong with Marvel and I‚Äôm not sure they can fix the damage these poor projects have done to their brand. We have had so many projects that have either underperformed, flopped or outright bombed since Endgame. This would have been unheard of in the Infinity Saga. Marvel movies are no longer must-sees amongst casual audiences. I am glad they are scaling back production but this was supposed to be one of the projects that they tried to ‚Äúfix‚Äù with reshoots."
OneSwords,2025-02-13 05:56:18,Still gonna see it to keep continuity. But god damn Marvel/Disney it cannot be that hard to hire competent directors ffs.

The_Franchise_09,2025-02-13 08:05:22,"Some in here said that they are changing production methods going forward, from Thunderbolts and F4FS and onward, by doing things more in pre- production, and even if that is true, which I don‚Äôt know if it is or not, the damage is still done. Like even if Thunderbolts, F4FS, Doomsday, Spider-Man 4, and Secret Wars are critical hits, I fear the damage has been done. So much of the Multiverse Saga has had mixed or poor reception, that they have done material damage to the reputation of the MCU. That‚Äôs my fear. They‚Äôve pissed away all of the goodwill from the general audience. Like it took actual effort to do that. It‚Äôs an impressive feat. Sad, but impressive. And you know what, it is so hard to reclaim and fix your reputation once you‚Äôve damaged it. It takes years to build up, and seconds to piss it all away.   I‚Äôm so angry and frustrated as a fan. For so many things. For pissing away all the goodwill they had, for wasting Gorr, who could have been a brilliant villain, to wasting Kang, to the wreck that Secret Invasion was and what they did to Maria Hill, to now diminishing Sam Wilson‚Äôs feature film debut as Cap. I‚Äôm also angry and sad for Mackie.   And I‚Äôm most angry and pissed at Kevin Feige and the rest of the Marvel and Disney for allowing it to happen. If we‚Äôre gonna give him credit for the highs of the Infinity Saga, he‚Äôs gonna take credit for the fuck ups of the Multiverse Saga and pissing away the goodwill of the general audience."
Prudent-Bar-2430,2025-02-13 06:08:51,"Unfortunately I was waiting for this to be a bomb. I haven‚Äôt had the chance to check out anything else Anthony Mackie has been in, but I found him to be very lacking as the lead in Falcon/Winter soldier.   I just‚Ä¶.didnt care? And the buddy cop angle they were going for with Bucky rang hollow. I might skip this altogether"
Jay__LeCaprio,2025-02-13 06:43:07,I want to believe the MCU can get back to phase 3 level of quality but it‚Äôs looking like it might be over
kazetoame,2025-02-14 12:22:53,I enjoyed it.
psychoxbandit,2025-02-13 21:40:44,I have 4 words to describe the entire movie.  IT WAS NOT ENOUGH.  Sure. Too much talking. Some mediocre action. All I wanted was to see the radiation leak out of red hulk. Red hulk angry. The final fight was only about 8-10 minutes long. Like what the hell was that.
DarkCelestial,2025-02-13 06:46:45,YIKES
201-inch-rectum,2025-02-13 07:30:31,bad word of mouth and horrible weather throughout the US is going to tank this movie
alexcutyourhair,2025-02-13 07:12:29,"I had a good enough time with it but frankly very little desire to rewatch it. I can rewatch the original Captain America trilogy endlessly, this one definitely felt like a step in the right direction after a lot of the recent projects but nothing that made me go ""wow"".   A few funny lines here, some decent action moves there, and some genuinely touching moments sprinkles in. I quite liked Harrison Ford here and I thought Anthony Mackie also did a good job. He might not be Steve Rogers but I do like how different this Captain America is.   I think the C grades are right on point, it's a decent to good movie but by no means the ""return to form"" we've been hoping for"
The_Franchise_09,2025-02-13 06:03:19,"I posted this in the spoiler sub but I feel that it‚Äôs worth sharing here too so I‚Äôll copy what I wrote there and share it here.  I‚Äôll withhold full judgment until I see it tomorrow, but these critic reviews are unacceptable for a studio that had 9 whole extra months, including a strike, to get this right. 48% is just straight up unacceptable, and it falls squarely on Kevin Feige‚Äôs lap. The pandemic was 5 years ago. Bob Chapek was ousted in late 2022 and filming for Brave New World didn‚Äôt start until 2023. Can‚Äôt blame the pandemic or Chapek anymore. Feige hired Julius Onah. Feige hired the writing team. I get that Feige has been generally revered amongst fans of the MCU. I mean, shit, me too. But I‚Äôm concerned that Feige has, and to borrow a football analogy, become Bill Belichick without Tom Brady. You can blame Secret Invasion, AMW- Quantumania, Love and Thunder on the pandemic and Chapek. But this you can‚Äôt. This is Kevin Feige‚Äôs fault, and this is the first time I find myself seriously questioning Kevin Feige‚Äôs ability as a producer. He‚Äôs had a great run, but sometimes people just lose their touch, and that‚Äôs what truly scares me as a fan. It may be time to have that conversation."
Dragon_yum,2025-02-13 19:35:55,The reviews are a bit harsh but not wrong. It‚Äôs an ok movie and honestly the sort run tune kind of helps it not overstay its welcome. I think the cast did a good job though I am still not sold on Anthony Mackie as a leading man.
HumongousMelonheads,2025-02-13 07:29:11,"It‚Äôs unfortunate that they took the break and said they were retooling things and it seems like this is just going to be more of the same post endgame marvel we‚Äôve come to know. This is really bad news, they said earlier that new cap was leading the avengers in the upcoming movies, but right now they have negative momentum. They better pray thunderbolts and fantastic four are really really good."
Theoneandonlyboy,2025-02-13 12:07:05,so pirate then
harryatomix,2025-02-13 12:47:10,Wow IGN really gave this movie 5 when they gave 8 to The Marvels.
demonoddy,2025-02-13 06:03:38,I think people are just sick of mediocre to okay MCU movies and are being overly harsh. Hopefully the rest of the projects this year are really great. I haven‚Äôt given up yet
bydevilz1,2025-02-13 19:43:41,MCU will announce 2 good films but make you watch through absolute shit slop to be able to watch the couple of good films they bring out
TolucaPrisoner,2025-02-13 07:56:48,"Let's be real, everyone saw this coming."
Omnislash99999,2025-02-13 15:56:19,"This movie had bomb written all over it from day one. If it gets around 50% RT and 300-400m WW it will have done better than my expectations.   Sam has been in like 6 movies and a show, nobody is going to care he finally got a solo movie"
meatballfreeak,2025-02-13 19:26:56,Feige should have left after Endgame ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
PickASwitch,2025-02-13 19:17:13,I have gone from buying MCU tickets the day they release to genuinely forgetting that this movie was even coming until I see a YT video thumbnail. Everything post Endgame feels directionless. Quantumania was the final straw for me. I have no interest in this. I have no interest in Fantastic Four. I have no interest in Thunderbolts. I have no interest in the alleged Blade movie. I am done with giving my money blindly to this brand.¬†
thevokplusminus,2025-02-13 20:09:33,Who would have thought the Steve Rodger‚Äôs passing the torch to someone older than him who will then fight the hulk without super powers wouldn‚Äôt work¬†
galaxyadmirer,2025-02-13 14:39:26,I‚Äôm still looking forward to watching this but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna spend the money for the ticket.
Big_Performance2495,2025-02-14 05:08:51,"I don‚Äôt know if it was just me or not, but it felt like a lot of the scenes in the movie were out of focus. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of how much backlighting they used or what, but I seemed to struggle to see certain scenes"
Far-Let4062,2025-02-14 12:10:22,"Just finished seeing it. I am unsure how many more MCU movies I can go see where I come away saying ""well that wasn't horrible but it also wasn't great"" before I stop caring all together. Thunderbolts looks promising but my low expectations for this were absolutely met."
comineeyeaha,2025-02-15 01:01:41,I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who liked this movie.
Toshimoko29,2025-02-13 09:20:06,"It‚Äôs to the point where you don‚Äôt have to wait for the movie to come out to know how the reviews will go. Thunderbolts will be better, 70s I assume. FF will be high 80s to low 90s. Everyone rushing to be the first to say they told us so or it wasn‚Äôt so bad. People making the same contradictory arguments to each other as if they just thought of it. ‚ÄúThe movies are too connected, you have to do homework to watch them!‚Äù but ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt connected enough anymore, they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre in the same world!‚Äù It‚Äôs all so tiring."
Intrepidatious,2025-02-13 07:02:18,"Listen I bought Disney+ for Marvel and Star Wars, but they need to stop Marvel shows and concentrate all their money and resources on the movies.   Either that or let Secret Wars end the current MCU, take a nap for a few years and let everyone start WANTING it again then start over."
Snelldor,2025-02-13 21:05:42,"Not going to lie, I think most of us saw this coming. Like Disney in the beloved year of 2025 is not the type of company to make brave political commentary in a big blockbuster movie."
ImportantSimple9,2025-02-13 18:32:33,"It's definitely the worst Captain America movie. No solid script. Wilson is a D-grade character, and Anthony is a B-grade celebrity. He and his character can't carry a Captain America movie. After *Winter Soldier* and *Civil War*, it's a huge letdown."
terrenobe,2025-02-13 07:54:08,I kind of expected this since the review embargo was lifted so close to opening day. That means that even Marvel knew this wouldn‚Äôt be great. At this point I am only going for the mystery Marvel Rivals skin.
JorReno,2025-02-13 17:50:58,... I hope Fantastic Four is good...
Wattentheworld,2025-02-14 01:41:14,"I said this in another thread, but it's been clear for a long time that this movie was focus grouped to death. It never stood a chance of being well-reviewed because any creative vision was so sliced up and diluted by committee. The best case scenario when that happens is ""a fine enough Marvel movie.""  They're not going to receive critical acclaim again until they let someone with an artistic vision just tell a story and execute it their own way. Their formula is critical poison at this point."
ek1mus,2025-02-13 17:48:05,"[empire review for good measure](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world/)   3/5  Decent film, that loses itself in the pace they choose to hurry from one action sequence to the next."
Mav3erick12,2025-02-13 19:47:47,"My review is that it's a Hulk movie without the Hulk in it, it's good don't get me wrong, I just wish there was more Bruce Banner involvement in the film"
Swagsuke_Nakamura,2025-02-14 23:05:11,"Just got back from the cinema seeing this. I‚Äôm a huge Captain America fan, and while I enjoyed it, I still felt that something is missing.  I like Anthony Mackie and I know it‚Äôs not his fault, but the Falcon character just isn‚Äôt a top star, and trying to follow Chris Evans‚Äô efforts is impossible. The jokes in the movie about taking the super-serum were funny, but it made me realise that a human Cap with some cool tech just isn‚Äôt the same, and it makes it kind of dull. When Bucky showed up, the room lit up and everyone including me was happy to see him, and then he left..  Also, Red Hulk being the main focal point and then only being in the film for like 10 minutes at the end was kinda lame, and the fact that it was over as quick as it started didn‚Äôt help.  I‚Äôd give it a 6.5, it just felt like everything was rushed and it needed just something more to keep it interesting."
necroblackbishop,2025-02-15 11:13:14,"I already had my doubts about this movie the moment I saw the trailer. While I enjoyed parts of the movie, I think I was most disappointed with how they handled Isaiah Bradley.   His character was tortured/experimented on,  fought for America during the Korean War, was imprisoned for 30 years, and hid away in Baltimore after he got out. And his entire arc in this movie was him being in jail AGAIN with possibility of the death penalty AFTER attempting to assassinate the president?"
Mr628,2025-02-13 07:28:15,Turns out that giving unknown directors and tv sitcom writers $200 million budgeted films is not a wise decision.
thehatstore42069,2025-02-14 00:17:01,BREAKING NEWS: sidekick of old hero replaces hero and isn't as popular.  I am shocked
Evorgleb,2025-02-13 05:53:44,"this is painful to read. I'll go see it anyway. Knowing that there are so many people out there that were hoping for this film to fail, I wouldn't doubt that bias is playing a part in many of these reviews but with so few of the reviews good, makes it seem like it is more than bias at play here."
PsycadaUppa,2025-02-13 17:49:58,I had no hopes for this movie. This movie from what I gathered was something still left over from the last regime at Disney.  The real test imo is gonna be thunderbolts and fantastic four if those two bomb then the mcu is absolutely cooked imo.
Galderick_Wolf,2025-02-13 18:25:28,"I just watched it. It's good. Not the best but also not the worst. I don't think you can say it's a bad movie cause it's not. I actually prefer this than The First Avengers, personally. Some fight choreography looks sloppy and since Ruth was an ex Widow, they should utilize her fight choreograph better. Joaquin is sooo cool and I love his dynamic with both Sam and Isaiah. Sam is very good tho, he's a very smart person so I really love his drama scenes."
headRN,2025-02-13 21:33:32,Marvel hasn‚Äôt appeared to have a real direction since end game.  The entire universe has felt really disjointed ever since. The eternals storyline went nowhere.  The Kang storyline was torpedoed by Jonathan Majors personal life.  Secret wars hasn‚Äôt really grabbed the attention beyond the diehard fans and a majority of its backstory has played out over the Disney+ shows.
epicskier123,2025-02-13 10:34:11,As a huge fan growing up (endgame out when I was 18) I am just disappointed with the constant ‚Äúmeh‚Äù movies. How do you go from releasing banger and banger in Phase 3 to having every other movie being meh?
Locoman7,2025-02-13 06:17:17,Can they just hand this shit over to actual comic book lovers for once.
iamkk9,2025-02-13 12:59:19,"You know what the issue is at Marvel? Time.   The corporate part of Disney just won‚Äôt let the creative part breathe for long enough that they can really flesh out ideas, even if they want to. If Fantastic 4 ends up being a poor movie it will be glaringly clear that these guys need to take a step back and just stop for a little bit (long overdue imo)"
Life_Bookkeeper2934,2025-02-13 15:47:27,"Marvel is like Manchester United now, had a glorious peak past but now is struggling in the present. The present is struggling a lot to live up to the past standards"
SubstantialBasket709,2025-02-13 19:04:49,"Just came out of the movie. Pleasantly surprised,it is a GOOD movie. Harrison and Anthony are great leads. I really liked Sam as the new Captain America.¬†"
Powerful_Star9296,2025-02-13 18:20:39,"No one is excited about Anthony Mackie. The CGI looks terrible. What even is this story line about? Marvel needs to stop immediately! Just because you made a mistake doesn‚Äôt mean you should keep pushing forward. The same goes for Star Wars. Start fresh, get fans excited, have direction, fire Kennedy and Feige."
Jeevansanghera1969,2025-02-13 06:31:03,"Really enjoyed it. Yes there are Weak points in the story, but they finally wrote Sam Wilson properly and not someone who was always whinging and complaining.  Anthony Mackie was great in this. I would watch it again"
rmac1228,2025-02-13 08:45:22,My son and I are seeing it tomorrow night.  Still excited!
Viz0077,2025-02-13 09:14:07,I canceled the tickets. Some of the reviews from genuine sites and even the shills were bad.
GoldLeaf55,2025-02-14 01:12:33,Man this is gonna be huge flop because of how much they spent on reshoots and marketing   But any sensible person who was not huffing copium would've been able to sense it  Anthony/Falcon is not at all the face/character that can lead a franchise or even a movie and the script and screenplay also did him no favours   Now if F4 and Thunderbolts also bomb at box office it is safe to say there won't even be much hype for Doomsday even  Now you'll be seeing the damage control which will try to shift the blame for this bomb on racism and 'marvel hate'
njf85,2025-02-13 14:04:52,"SPOILERS (I don't know how to black out sections)  Just left the cinema with hubby. I avoided any and all reviews beforehand. Personally, I enjoyed it. In terms of MCU ranking, I'd place it in the middle- not one of the best but certainly not one of the worst. Really loved the new Falcon, and Mackie carried the movie well.  I suspect they cut alot of Sabra's scenes out. You get a brief glimpse of her in her white-blue suit (albeit under a coat) prior to the Celestial Island battle, but then she doesn't make an appearance or fight in it. That's all you see of it. I can't imagine why they'd make the suit but then not even show her in it properly so I'm assuming scenes got cut.  Celestial Island battle was awesome (dunno what was with Cap surfing a missile though lol). And I also loved that there were a few jabs about Sam's counselling past throughout but then later when it's clear Red Hulk is too strong, Sam falls back on counselling the guy down. I feel like that will divide some people but I liked it. Sam played to his strengths. He acknowledges he should have taken the serum because physically he can't compete. Also loved the cameo and pep talk from a certain someone.  So yeah, overall we enjoyed it. Very entertaining."
Previous_Spell_426,2025-02-13 06:19:58,"Watch it last night. It‚Äôs fun, definitely middle of the road marvel. The performances are good, and I found a lot of the action to be a lot of fun. Post credits scene isn‚Äôt really worth waiting around for tbh."
AsterArtworks,2025-02-13 07:11:57,"From all these reviews I can‚Äôt really gage what is actually disappointing about this movie, it‚Äôs too vague for me to agree with. I‚Äôll have to see it tomorrow"
jgreg728,2025-02-13 07:26:21,Everyone still making excuses for Marvel mediocrity I see.
R0gueX3,2025-02-13 19:51:32,"I'll probably go see it this weekend, but Maevel has honestly been really hit or miss for me lately. I'm hoping Fantastic 4 is good, but I'm not 100 percent on that one either. Though I do enjoy the ""vibes"" so far."
Knuxsn,2025-02-13 20:53:43,"Obviously, we should see the movie and decide for ourselves if we like it, but this definitely hurts given it's a Captain America movie. This should have been a movie Marvel ensured was great and well received."
slunksoma,2025-02-13 21:16:07,"Few of us had exceptionally high hopes for this, and expected it to be fine, which is fine. But this sounds like a mess.   Glad I spent some brownie points to take my girlfriend on Valentine‚Äôs Day.   (As with most of these, suspect it isn‚Äôt as bad as these reviews make out)."
InternalTable6400,2025-02-14 04:27:22,This movie was not bad at all‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôd give it a 7/10 people calling it bad are just haters point blank period. Watch it for yourself and make a judgement because half these reviews I read after watching the movie make zero sense to me¬†
Deleted,2025-02-14 07:19:43,"The villain was the weakest link, I enjoyed the performances of both Ford and Mackie"
ColdWarCharacter,2025-02-14 09:12:27,"Brave New World has the bones of a decent movie, but there‚Äôs a lot of the problems. The writers played Sam too straight and dry. Mackie has a decent comedic presence, so idk why they leaned away from it. There‚Äôs a lot of older Marvel movie stuff mentioned, that should have been mentioned before now. It felt like too much of it either should have been just dropped or referenced in some way in the last couple years. This one had ‚Äúdo your MCU homework‚Äù before watching, which has been a huge issue for the MCU. I think if it just picked a lane and stayed in it, it might have been a decent film, but instead they just chose to drive all over the road with it"
SpacePrezLazerbeam,2025-02-14 11:33:11,It was mid. Didn't like the leader makeup. Too much stabbing. Thought the writing felt clunky. The core plot is solid tho.   Why was the leader in that suburban house? Was that a relic from a previous cut?
Bleezy79,2025-02-14 11:42:11,I wish the trailers didnt give it away that Ross turns into the red hulk.  That would have made a cool surprise.
TheNewBlue,2025-02-14 12:30:21,"Just got out of the theatre and it was just ok. The heros were fun, the fight scenes were good. The villain was kind of boring. The story was not good. I would put it next to Iron Man 3 on a quality tier list. Definitely not a great kick off to the new avengers story line."
carrion409,2025-02-14 20:38:01,"I'd give the movie a 5 or 6 at the very most. Without spoilers (though if you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the spoilers), the best way to sum it up is they took the idea for a filler episode from a potential falcon and the winter soldier season 2 and made it a two hour movie. I genuinely dont know how much longer Marvel can keep putting out below average movies before people just stop seeing them. If thunderbolts ends up being a stinker, then we need to start asking the people running the show the hard questions. I know personally if thunderbolts is bad, then I'm done. I'm tired of waiting for some magical thing that's going to fix these films. ""Just wait for the xmen bro"" "" just wait, they're gonna come back with the next Avengers, bro,"" Feigie needs to pray that thunderbolts knocks it out of the park."
ryanandhobbes,2025-02-15 00:30:47,"I left feeling shocked anyone even uttered this movie in the same breath as Winter Soldier, even with regard to what the film was trying to do, because this movie is ASTOUNDINGLY bad."
NinetyYears,2025-02-15 03:35:04,BNW was enjoyable. I have to thank the whiners and edgelords for lowering my expectations I guess. I was satisfied from start to finish.   No lower than a 7/10. Better than movies like Iron Man 2 & 3.
Purplebobkat,2025-02-15 04:34:47,Half the cinema left halfway through in our viewing
AnyPrinciple4378,2025-02-15 11:16:53,I enjoyed it but I thought it was weird how quick the Japanese US feud nearly led to war and how quickly they went back to signing the treaty.

Pristine-Menu4156,2025-02-15 23:05:40,This may be an unpopular opinion but I LIKED brave new world and would give it a solid 8 or 8.5 out of 10. Please don‚Äôt hate me.
epigen01,2025-02-17 06:17:13,Not really a nitpick but recasting Harrison Ford as Ross threw me for a loop bc Ford is just sucha likeable actor - compared to the long history of Hurt's Ross (hated in the MCU just by seeing him on screen).  Ford's Ross turning heel really benefits from Ford's favorability & audiences' love for the guy
bookon,2025-02-19 11:48:17,It‚Äôs better than the last  Thor or Antman.   It‚Äôs better than the eternals or secret invasion or falcon and winter soldier.  It‚Äôs better than black widow.   It‚Äôs middle of the road MCU. But that‚Äôs still pretty good.

Even though race has nothing to do with it.¬†   It was obvious from the start that the writing itself was garbage when they forced the main character to decline the super solider serum.   Why would we feel any tension for a character who themselves chose to fight 1 hand tied behind their back?   It's like Goku never going super Saiyan during a fight, you just know there's no danger for him to choose not to transform.   Declining the serum is just that, at any point in the movie if there's a struggle, the back of our minds is thinking why is he doing this, why not just take the serum and end the movie???¬†"

I have grown up with these movies since I was in first grade and I‚Äôll be honest, I have lost faith in them over time, especially after endgame, especially these past four years. I‚Äôve liked/loved some of their projects the last few years, and I‚Äôve also disliked some as well. I‚Äôve had plenty of issues with MOM, L&T, Quantumania, the Marvels, I could keep going.   This movie was honestly amazing. I think GOTG vol 3 for the record has been marvels best film since endgame, I would put this right below it. The action, the performances were great. SAMUEL STERNS AS THE VILLAIN?!? Dude was so creepy and awesome. It‚Äôs a true back to form marvel movie. So much good pay off and references from past projects while also setting up what‚Äôs to come. It was great. I was so skeptical going into it and I can honestly say the negative reviews are a bunch of bs. There‚Äôs maybe one scene you can tell that was reshot but that doesn‚Äôt bring the movie down at all imo.

MuggaSoup,2025-02-15 01:11:57,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It is very reminiscent of Harrison Fords older pics like Fugitive and Firewall, and even reminded me of Under Siege with Steven Segal, and War Games. From a story perspective, I was expecting to be very out of the loop having not seen any of the TV shows or Black Widow, but I found it very easy to follow.   Cap 2 is my favorite MCU movie and always has been. They adhere to that tone and those themes with this sequel and it does not feel recycled. It is very fair to consider this as much a Hulk (2008) sequel as it is Cap 4. All its missing is the actual Hulk, who they could have shoe horned in but opted not to (good choice IMO). Excellent villain, 17 years in the making.    From a cinematography perspective, I was impressed. It was very stylized. A lot of thought was put into composing each shot, making even slow dialogue laden scenes interesting to look at. Big scenes felt big and exhilarating. Very 80's in its neon red and blue lighting which aided in the tone of high stakes  global and political tensions . good use of shadows. Star wars vibes from the command centers and war rooms. Classic uses of canted angels and angled perspectives to show mystery, power and weakness.  I thought Black Panther 2 and Doctor Strange 2 were messy and uninteresting trash. Guardians 3 I though was decent despite all the goo and fan service. There are so many now that I havent seen and I think alot of the people leaving bad reviews are either incredibly burnt out and jaded, or have some pretty unreasonable expectations.  But this was a good sequel and a decent movie. Harrison Ford acted the sh\*t out of his role. Anthony Mackie, as he is always reminding everyone, has big shoes to fill and is doing his best, his performance was great. His side kick was only annoying sometimes, overall good character. The dog fight over the ocean looked so much better than the final battle from black panther 2. This feel like progress."

Th3Alch3m1st,2025-02-15 05:35:31,"Just got out of the cinema. Pretty disappointed.   The good: - Anthony did a good job with what he had to work with and is still one of the more solid actors in the MCU. Carl Lumbly did a great job with an extended role as Isaiah. Would have like more Esposito. The rest of the supporting actors were fine, nothing horrendous, but nothing stellar either. - VFX was clean, and much better than a lot of the garbage Marvel has been dumping out. - Cinematography was surprisingly good for a franchise that isn't really known for it. Nothing crazy, but it did feel like a bit more care was placed on composition than your typical MCU movie.  The bad: - It was just boring. At least it wasn't a chaotic mess like Love and Thunder, but I just had a difficult time staying focused tonight.  - The political storyline was so poorly constructed. Civil War is proof that the political stuff can work well for superhero movies if done well. Instead it was just a pretty weak theme to move the story along.  - Why did they rock up to camp echo one with like zero gear? Did I miss something or why didn't they have their suits or something while entering a potentially secure facility?  Overall 6/10"

It definitely wasn‚Äôt the best MCU movie, by far, but it was still pretty good and entertaining. We all rated the movie on a scale of 0-10. The kids‚Äô ratings were 7/10, 8/10, and 9/10. My rating was 6ish/10.¬†  There was a preview before the movie for Thunderbolts*. (anyone know why there is an * after the title?) It looks great!  Make sure you stay put after the movie ends.

The introduction of Adamantium into the MCU was cool to see with a proper connection to the celestial just chilling in the ocean, finally.  The tone of Falcon & Winter Soldier was all over it, and I really enjoyed the dynamic between Sam‚Äôs Cap and Falcon again. Isaiah and Sam‚Äôs chemistry was excellent. Harrison Ford was absolutely brilliant, and played Ross very well - literally nothing to complain about. I wish we had more Hulk scenes like the end battle in other films. Seeing Ford‚Äôs Red Hulk jump over to the monument was Eric Bana like. Please Kevin, please. Let Hulk be Hulk again.  Sterns pulling the strings was the stronger part of the plot obviously but it seems like it won‚Äôt get acknowledged as such because of how much people don‚Äôt like The Incredible Hulk. Lots of people skipped it along the way so he‚Äôs an unknown character as result of that. As someone who likes TIH, it was so sick seeing his character come to fruition all these years later. It also felt like a lot of his later scenes were added during reshoots though.  Esposito being such a minor character in the MCU felt so strange too, it‚Äôs like he was back as Gus Fring for one more time.  Now‚Ä¶ As someone who loves this Marvel Studios era of world building, it‚Äôs getting harder to see the clear direction of the future leading into these next two Avengers films in particular. The post credits scene confirmed my doubt in what direction Doomsday, let alone Secret Wars will go in.  Sam tasked to rebuild the Avengers a year or so out with only Fantastic Four and Thunderbolts on screen before Avengers: Doomsday releases looks like disaster waiting to happen. I hate comparing to the build leading up to Infinity War but it‚Äôs really hard not to doubt Avengers 5 being successful in this current run/phase with no proper cohesion.  Don‚Äôt fuck up Doom, please."

The villain is played sympathetically which is fine but he gets multiple ‚Äòdeep down I really want ___‚Äô scenes and that‚Äôs more time that should‚Äôve been spent on Sam. Sam never really gets his ‚ÄòI want‚Äô song aside from ‚ÄòI want to help my friend,‚Äô and ‚ÄòI (occasionally) consider how much better I might‚Äôve been with the serum*,‚Äô - which could‚Äôve been tightened with another pass at the script to solidify what the main thesis of what he was after was.¬† Otherwise he doesn‚Äôt develop much beyond just being his usual badass self, which is fine, but could‚Äôve been more enjoyable if he had a more cohesive introspective internal conflict.  *speaking of which, lots of weird moments where it becomes really confusing that he isn‚Äôt an enhanced super soldier because he shrugs off stabbings like they‚Äôre nothing.

I'm not gonna compare this to Steve Rogers Captain America films because that's a different character's journey, this is Sam Wilson's. I will compare this to the Disney+ Falcon and the Winter Soldier though -- and I gotta say I liked that series a lot better than this one. that didn't have too much boardroom editing (other than avoiding the coincidental bio weapon thing of 2020), but with Brave New World...good grief the editing and scrubbing out and massive course correcting was really obvious üëÄ. they rewrote this thing several times, reshot this thing several times AND IT SHOWED ü§¶. I do like the augmentation of Sam's Captain America with Wakandan tech, I always felt that Sam's CA was to Batman the way Steve's CA was to Superman. and that was what I was REALLY looking forward to for MCU's stories for Sam Wilson CA-- the more Batman-y type hero because we already saw Rogers' Superman-y version from Phase 1-3. but instead they keep bringing up Sam's skin color and largely hamstring'd his Cap to that ü§¶ . it's very frustrating because there's SO MUCH MORE to Sam Wilson as Captain America than just his skin color ferchrisakes ü§¶. anyways, I don't know what else they got planned for Sam's Cap, I feel it's just one mistep after another, it's like they don't know what to do with his character after Falcon and the Winter Soldier. I really do like Anthony Mackie as Cap, I really like Red Hulk and Harrison Ford, I liked that they brought back The Leader, heck I was thrilled when Liv Tyler decided to actually show up and reprise her role. it's a 7/10 for me, and again I really, really want them to bring back Sam Wilson as Cap, he deserves much more stories to tell as a more human-level Cap¬† (without having to rehash over and over the lamentations of his skin color geezus)."
LargelyInnocuous,2025-02-17 13:16:16,All of those still had more heart than some of the new stuff being put out.
ComoEstanBitches,2025-02-17 14:36:37,This felt more like MCU Hulk 2 than a Captain America movie. The espionage and don‚Äôt call me black widow all fell flat. Anthony Mackie deserves better but his Sam Wilson as the Cap‚Äôn still got that TFAWTS stench on the big screen. I probably made the mistake of watching Top Gun Maverick leading up to the movie and subconsciously compared it to what Sam Wilson Captain America could‚Äôve been

I do feel him being black and the second character being mexican and the racial undertones are reasons it is not as favored. I also think the marketing was manipulative in terms of weirdly trying to make it a red hulk film which it is NOT. I liked the political spy element too"

GatorBo69,2025-02-15 14:36:01,"Just saw Captain America tonight and it was, imo, the MCU getting back on track. It wasn‚Äôt great, it wasn‚Äôt bad, the best way I can compare it to other MCU movies is that it was better than Thor The Dark World, which is at the top of the worst ranked MCU movies.  That‚Äôs me setting aside my love for the MCU and being as objective as I can.  It had its moments, my wife who isn‚Äôt a MCU dork like me but has seen every MCU movie once enjoyed it.  It had a good core plot with Sterns at the center of it, it was a bit muddled with a few too many sub plots as well, but Anthony Mackie did a great job as being worthy of carrying the shield.  Also, finally ‚ÄúCelestial Island‚Äù was a focal point and I thought it was a creative way to introduce adamantium.  Cap‚Äôs suit was badass, and the struggle of him not taking the serum is what makes him a great Cap. With his Vibranium suit he is very powerful and it‚Äôs not just about the abilities he can do in the suit, it‚Äôs his mastery over it that makes him great. Just as Torres was a great example that having great tech doesn‚Äôt automatically make you great.  I predict this is the year of the return of the MCU. Fantastic Four WILL be great, anyone who thinks otherwise, please screenshot this and call me out later if you disagree when you see it. It‚Äôs a passion project for Feige and it will be epic.  And then there‚Äôs the Thunderbolts*, which I think will be the best of all 3. From what I saw of the new trailer, it looks like a badass fun filled ride. The only thing that will have to be answered is what happens to Bucky. He‚Äôs a Congressman in ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù with his act together. Now he could still be that Congressman but he‚Äôs let his hair grow back out so something must happen to him. Unless he simply does this on the side.  Regardless, Cap 4 was above average, and I think of the beginning of the resurgence of the MCU. Every movie can‚Äôt be knocked out of the park and after Endgame they simultaneously accomplished an amazing feat of having a true ending to an epic saga that NO other studio will ever duplicate. On the other hand they basically had to start all over.  It‚Äôs like Alabama having Nick Saban and being dominate, then he leaves and they slump, but they will eventually return to prominence.  Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good analogy or not, but that‚Äôs the best I got! lol.   All I know is this year has some great movies that I‚Äôm pumped about. Superman, Jurassic Park and one of my most anticipated movies, Mission Impossible Final Reckoning, which I truly believe Ethan Hunt will die in this last film. Mission Impossible will continue, but just like 007, they‚Äôll find a suitable replacement. But dang, he looks like he‚Äôs running a true marathon in. This one as opposed to his normal mile or two. üòù"

R_WeDoingPhrasing,2025-02-13 10:21:22,I could give a shit about movie reviewers. Plenty of films that have graced the MCU have been eviscerated because they aren't a top 10 MCU movie.

RocketAppliances97,2025-02-13 09:08:07,"Why do we still put so much stock in RT score? Deadpool & Wolverine 78%, MoM 74%, Thor 77%, Captain America 80%, GOTG 3 82%. the first antman is rated higher than all of those at 83% and antman and the wasp (87%) is rated higher than infinity war (85%). I think we can all agree that infinity war is not a worse movie than antman 2. review scores are meaningless when some movies have 2000 critic reviews and others have 50. Review scores are meaningless when a 5/10 is considered ‚Äúunwatchable slop‚Äù but it is literally the definition of MID. Middling, median, average. 50% of people liked the movie, 50% didn‚Äôt like it making it exactly that. Average. Mid. People saying it‚Äôs amazing are disingenuous, people saying it‚Äôs dogshit are being disingenuous. People can say it a million times, I have yet to think marvel has made a completely unwatchable movie. The quality has dropped but people genuinely see a movie with mid reviews and act like it‚Äôs a 1/10 piece of shit that should never have been made."

Sam does have an upgrade enough to compensate the lack of super serum (even more awesome than Steve in some instances).. Indeed he does not have the aura of one Steve Rogers but he fit perfectly in the mantle, and I like his own dilemma too. The cameo was nice too.  Understand that this is a soft reboot and to me it felt like a earlier MCU movie (establish characters and setup some events) and it's okey !

The worst you can say about something like Ant-Man 2 for example is the story is bland. But it flows how you expect a movie to flow  These phase 4/5 movies. It's like they're butchering them in reshoots and the editing room. Like it feels like the film was cut to shreds to keep it under a certain run time. And the VFX guys just don't have the time to make it work. The script just isn't that good and they don't know where they want the saga to go.

Same writer as FatWS, and while I enjoyed it fine enough it was mostly because of the chemistry between the characters, which felt like it was coming more from performance than writing, and there's only a couple of those relationships returning.  2. I found Mackie much more enjoyable to watch as Falcon than as Cap. His charisma changed when he took up the shield.  3.

The last film before the current one, D&W was a major hit, before that there was GOTG3, BPWF, SMNWY that were also well recieved. You would have to be a generally pessimistic or just all round miserable person to look back at Marvel Studios movies released in last five to six years and come to the conclusion that they pretty much summed up to...  >‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, switch off my brain popcorn flick, I‚Äôll watch it on D+, not bad not great‚Äù  That's not mentioning the convenience of pretending Marvel Studios movie releases pre-Endgame were a succession of slam dunk hits.

Sure at the time Marvel Studios movies were still a novelty and everyone was just giddy about the whole thing to be complaining about it at every turn.   The MCU has always been a mixed bag in terms of quality, let's not pretend this is something. Nevertheless, this is just my opinion, so go on."

Potential-Web9147,2025-02-15 07:54:37,"From what I have read or looked at the movie from the trailer the problems have to do with the plot rather than the characters. What this movie seems to do is focus on multiple stories that don't connect to anything that is related to captain america as a character like focusing on Harrison Ford as hulk for far too long, different materials that are more about black panther than captain america, us and Japan diplomatic relations. These plot points in the story don't add to anything about Captain America's ideals like in the previous movies that explore what his beliefs are about a specific topic like government surveillance, loyalty to friendship over the government, regulations on superheroes etc. If you're going to write a superhero story about one character than have that main character be the focus of the story instead of chopping everything into different stories that seem like filler rather than a cohesive story. Make the new captain america learn how to both be himself but also understand the morals of his predecessor like what happened with miles morales in the spider verse series than the movie would be far better."

More characters we recognise on a single space might be fun, but either of these movies sound so uninteresting at this point.  mcu doesn't have the nerds by the balls, like it did 5 years ago. So they either have to go all in or nothing.  Isn't there a comic book with redhuk and the Ross team vs the hulk or something, just do that storyline."

Up to that point, the MCU was a remarkable achievement‚Äîlong-term storytelling, a relatively consistent vision across interconnected properties, a focus on narrative over political messaging, and some of the most compelling characters in comic book history.  Following that was always going to be an impossible act‚Äîespecially for a studio that has since proven it understands almost none of those things."

Nor do I think anyone should let reviews dictate their taste or opinions - which still seems to be a massive problem with a lot of people.   If you are personally interested in seeing a movie, see it. Stop letting critics tell you how to feel.

labbla,2025-02-13 07:31:10,It's not the directors at fault. But the Marvel machine that micromanages every aspect of production and changes movies due to fickle executives and test screenings. They can never just let their creatives actually make a movie.
davinitupoverhere,2025-02-13 06:21:19,"You do know directors aren‚Äôt solely at fault here right? In fact, most reviews say the director made some great stylish decisions, especially with fight choreography. Most of the time though it boils down to bad writing and/or writing from too many parties (mainly the studios intervening and clashing with the original vision). This whole thing is unfortunately a carry-over from Bob Chapek‚Äôs time at Disney, when he greenlit too many Marvel projects - not inspired by any particular stories, but their propensity to make money. Feige and co are still recovering from that era."

wookiewin,2025-02-13 07:23:32,Issue isn‚Äôt the directors. It‚Äôs having completed scripts ready before shooting.

njf85,2025-02-13 14:42:59,The directing was definitely one of the movie's weaknesses
nick2473got,2025-02-13 06:19:49,"I'm admittedly a bit of a normie and not the most knowledgeable about up and coming directors and writers but I really feel like one of the main issues with the MCU now is that they keep hiring absolute nobodies or people who have huge potential but zero experience with these kinds of productions, and it shows.   It doesn't feel like there are any practiced hands on the directorial and script-writing sides of these movies. Everything feels amateurish now.   There have been exceptions of course like Sam Raimi and Chloe Zhao but overall the people helming these projects just have not been good enough."
Vitzkyy,2025-02-13 06:14:48,"I dont think Cap 4 is the breaking point, I think F4 first steps is. If that movie doesn‚Äôt work out I think Marvel is in big trouble"
WillowSmithsBFF,2025-02-13 06:00:07,"TBH, a lot of the problems we‚Äôre seeing in these recent movies were also here pre-Endgame (shoddy CGI, rushed 3rd acts, very ‚Äúclean‚Äù looking, etc). Black Panther was an absolutely insane cultural phenomenon and its final battle looked like a video game from 2012. Even Infinity War had some questionable CGI.   The biggest difference now is people (and critics especially) are less tolerant of the issues than they used to be. Not saying that excuses all the issues, as there are very obvious and frustrating issues with the newer stuff. But take The Marvels, for example, and release it before Endgame. Probably ends up with a 80%+ on RT.   The speed at which they‚Äôve pumped these recently out also doesn‚Äôt help. Marvel movies used to feel like big events, now they‚Äôre ‚Äújust another Marvel thing.‚Äù"
ArmorOfGod7,2025-02-13 11:09:01,"So basically, a Marvel film that would have gotten an 80-90 in phases 1-3 now gets a 50-60."
ManitouWakinyan,2025-02-13 05:59:03,It definitely feels like we're well out of the era where decent Marvel movies will get good reviews.
TheAnonymouse999,2025-02-13 06:37:02,Part of the reason the previous films were given extra grace is because each individual fed into something bigger that was engaging and entertaining as a whole. That‚Äôs not the case anymore.

_Wp619_,2025-02-13 13:11:30,">Like even if Thunderbolts, F4FS, Doomsday, Spider-Man 4, and Secret Wars are critical hits, I fear the damage has been done.  Brother, that'll be five consecutive successes for the MCU. There is no ""the damage has been done"" if that occurs."
Head_Mission2984,2025-02-15 15:36:15,Phase 4&5 have been utter dog crap. I can't get over how watching every series and most movies I always come to the same thought:   That was a waste of time.
Adorable_Ad_3478,2025-02-13 12:22:10,"A super important point is that when Marvel cast Mackie, Sam Wilson wasn't Captain America in the comics. They cast him as a sidekick. And it shows.  Comparing him to any of the leads who got initially cast as leads (RDJR, Evans, Hemsworth, Pratt, Boseman, etc...), the difference in screen presence and charisma is MASSIVE.  BP2 suffered from the same thing. Shuri was never intended to takeover the mantle and become the main BP. T'Challa was meant to be one of the leads of Phases 4-6. And Wright's screen presence is only a tiny fraction of Boseman's."
____mynameis____,2025-02-13 16:13:34,"That happens when you cast a character to be a comic relief side kick, characterise, sideline him just like that and then decide to make him a leading man material in one last movie.  I know Anthony gets a lot of bad rep for not being leading guy material but I also think the MCU itself did  majority of the damage by making him a fun blindly loyal side kick to cap for most of his appearances, then flipped it in EG. Ffs, they couldn't even include him in AOU main roster and had to sent him globetrotting off screen , searching for ""Cap's BFF"". They always showed him as guy following orders than a true equal friend to Steve. Bucky getting co lead/Cap's ""equal"" treatment and overshadowing Sam for the 2 Cap movies doesn't help either.   Shows how a lot of the problems we have now are just just crumbling from the cracks that formed at the end Infinity Saga."
Deleted,2025-02-13 06:19:12,[deleted]
TheJoshider10,2025-02-13 06:17:05,Bucky should have been Captain America. Sam Wilson was never more than just a side character and Antony Mackie doesn't have the screen presence or charisma to carry a movie.  I'm never going to believe that this guy is meant to lead the Avengers into battle. It'll be laughable seeing him try and motivate characters played by the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Hemsworth.
PickASwitch,2025-02-13 19:21:28,"Not everyone is meant to be a lead, and that‚Äôs ok. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a solid supporting. He‚Äôs great in Winter Soldier. One of my favorite moments in that movie is when Sam immediately opens his home to Cap and Nat, at great risk to himself. I just don‚Äôt think Mackie is a leading man for this kind of movie."

ColdWarCharacter,2025-02-14 08:56:15,Anthony Mackie was actually pretty funny in The Night Before and Twisted Metal was more fun than it should have been.
j1h15233,2025-02-13 08:19:53,Phase 3 had two other phases build it up though. Phase 5 is technically like phase 2 in that regard
esar24,2025-02-13 13:24:43,"No one can mitigate the sucess of Infinity Saga, not even MCU themselves."
SeattleStudent4,2025-02-13 14:57:45,"It's over, you can't replicate that. The MCU was such a novel and ambitious thing to begin with. It introduced and developed characters that we cared about. The pacing was near-perfect. There would be months of buildup to each movie. It was so exciting when a trailer dropped. The scale of the films got bigger and bigger over time without getting too crazy, all leading up to a huge 'finale' in Infinity War and Endgame, which were executed as well as anyone could ever have expected.   Now? It's not new anymore. There are a ton of projects and characters we don't care about. There's a huge scale problem because you can't just keep going bigger and bigger, and more down to earth stories (figuratively and literally) are not going to be as intriguing or exciting. There's nothing the MCU is ""building to"" anymore. Doomsday and Secret Wars are on the horizon and will be big, but they just feel like standalone future movies at this point. The stories feel tired, because in one way or another it's always been done before...and I mean it's been done before previously in the MCU, not in the history of filmmaking. And then of course there's this whole thing where every single scene has to have humor in it, appropriate or not. Every character has to be funny. Even a really serious character is only going to be really serious to the end of comedic effect.    And then there's the bigger issues of how much filmmaking these days is driven by algorithms and focus groups."

The_Franchise_09,2025-02-13 06:07:27,"The fact that Sam Wilson‚Äôs first full feature outing as Cap has been mishandled has me angry as a fan. I‚Äôve spent years defending Mackie getting the shield, and defending why he got the shield. I‚Äôve advocated for Sam and I‚Äôve advocated for this movie, and the fact that it‚Äôs falling flat on its face has me angry as a fan. This is Kevin Feige‚Äôs fault. He is the creative head of the damn studio. This is his responsibility. Creatively mishandling a Captain America movie should have him feeling the heat and pressure from the Disney board and shareholders. Just flat out unacceptable"
The_Franchise_09,2025-02-13 06:04:19,"It‚Äôs flat out unacceptable. This is a studio that used to piss excellence and consistency. Bob Iger and the rest of board and shareholders should be demanding an answer on why a pivotal film that was Sam Wilson‚Äôs first feature outing as Cap (and what it meant to be a Black Captain America), a film that cost $180 million, was handed to a director that wasn‚Äôt qualified and to writers that weren‚Äôt qualified. I‚Äôve defended Feige before. He had a tremendous run through 2021. But there‚Äôs no more pandemic or Bob Chapek to blame. If Marvel Studios can‚Äôt find its way back to consistency and excellence under Feige, then it‚Äôs time to have a hard conversation and find an executive that will."

UnhingedHippie,2025-02-13 07:34:49,"One thing I like to point out is that Marvel Studios is a studio. Not every movie is going to be gold and even then with the earlier movies, not all of them were great. I feel like a lot of people just want to hold on to their member berries and forget that the MCU was in a WAY worse position than they are now, but that could be because there is a lot more eyes on the MCU and just overall movie goers becoming cynical. I think the best example would be the Iron Man series. A lot of people like to look on it favorably but if it came out today the later 2 films would be considered ‚Äúmid‚Äù (Iron Man 2 and 3 weren‚Äôt considered great movies in any aspect except effects and box office) and with how hostile movie audiences are I‚Äôm not sure how well  Iron Man 1 does."
Initial_XD,2025-02-13 07:25:36,"I honestly don't get this sentiment. Where do people get the idea that people are sick of mediocre MCU films like every MCU film in the last five years has just been MEH, like every MCU film before that was just hit after hit after hit? I am honestly confused by this because I don't think there's ever been a period when the MCU had a flawless record."
j1h15233,2025-02-13 08:19:10,I definitely agree with this. It‚Äôs like most people just wanted it to all end after Endgame and they‚Äôre upset it‚Äôs still going

rowthecow,2025-02-14 14:09:22,there was ZERO character build up in any previous movie or tv to Sam being cap. Evans spent one full movie convincing us he IS cap.

hycin01,2025-02-14 02:01:06,"Phase 3 was after a decade of build-up. Phase 1 and especially 2 had a lot of meh or outright bad movies (The Dark World, Iron Man 3, Ant-Man, Iron Man 2, Incredible Hulk). Haven't seen the movie yet, but tbf, it did go through a ton of rewrites and reshoots because of current events that probably messed the film up. They also had their original plan and release timeline messed up because of Covid and probably rushed things out too fast to make up for it and took on more projects at once than they should've. Though I'd say the shows have mostly been pretty good overall and just a lot of times have kinda mid finales (not caught up on the Phase 5 ones, though, tbf)."

ecb1912,2025-02-14 12:31:56,There was so much foreshadowing in the film that felt ruined by the marketing around Red Hulk who wasn‚Äôt even the villain in the story-just an obstacle.   I felt like the whole 3rd act should‚Äôve been Red Hulk- for as much as he was marketed before the film‚Äôs release he needed to play a bigger role as an antagonist.

DandadanAsia,2025-02-15 11:28:07,this is why the movie suck. there is no way that Japan and US will get into feud since both have a treaty. Its more believable if its China-US but Disney don't want to upset their Chinese overlord so picked the country that no one will believe will have feud with the US in the real life.

Knuckleheaded-beardo,2025-02-13 15:24:54,"Yeah, I'm in the minority with you. Cast is very underwhelming for F4. Especially compared to both the previous adaptations. Yes, both.  The cast individually is great. I could give a pass on the other actors. But nothing will convince me pedro was ever or will ever be a good choice for Reed.  Wouldn't be surprised if F4 turns out to be middle of the road. Personally, I'm expecting a meh movie with that one."

EntireLi_00,2025-02-13 15:29:15,"What you said is right but 8 seems kinda high. I just saw it. Even as a biased Marvel fan, who will enjoy anything they put out, myself, this feels okay but mid. Maximum lower than 7, 6.5 or 6.9/10 for me. It's beautiful, I love its stunning background and great aerial dogfight scene, but at the end I don't feel the same way I feel from any previous Marvel movies. It feels like a 'Marvel Presents Special Presentation' instead. I'm gonna watch it again later maybe something will change."

The actors gave wonderful performances but the writing just wasn‚Äôt inspired or interesting at all.   If you haven‚Äôt gone to see the movie in theatres, just wait for it to stream.

PhoenixStormed,2025-02-14 23:54:31,This is the issue w the movie along w bad fight choreography and uninspired directing and script that felt pieced together.  They need to start mining entire plots from the comics and not just the titles and then doing their own thing. Sam as cap has storylines already Westin in the comics complete w fucking storyboards done!  This should have been a vehicle for Sam and instead it‚Äôs a hulk sequel he‚Äôs starring in.  Even the villain was focused on red hulk not Sam Sam was just there as a way to get back at Ross.  Who the hell came up w this nonsense when fatws was cooking w something that related to Sam! Continue that with zemo! Throw in serpent society and viper and Sharon Carter instead of that dwarf who can‚Äôt act.  Then add Bucky and cut the falcon or if Bucky couldn‚Äôt do it because of thunderbolts being in Eli Bradley and beef up Isiah‚Äôs role.  Keep the Bucky cameo as it was a highlight of the movie and showed what this movie could have been.  Also where were the Easter eggs!  None at the vault???  Lame. I wanted my hellcat appearance!

The focus on tv shows put out too much content   There‚Äôs been little forward progress (we still have no resolution to the Shang-Chi post credit scene)  There have been too many plot points introduced (why introduce the Eternals and Marvel supernatural on top of the multiverse, FF, X-Men, etc?)  There‚Äôs no main character anymore.  We knew Tony and Cap were the stars, who is that now?"
CosmicAstroBastard,2025-02-13 15:24:14,"Love and Thunder was literally a 4 hour movie cut down to 2 hours according to Taika Waititi.   They can‚Äôt keep letting these movies make it all the way into post production without checking to see if they‚Äôre meeting basic requirements like ‚Äúcan this story be told in 2-2.5 hours?‚Äù or ‚Äúdoes this have a beginning, a middle and an end?‚Äù"
justins_dad,2025-02-13 09:08:32,It honestly feels like every other franchise without Feige. It‚Äôs almost like he quit.¬†
AverageAwndray,2025-02-13 06:55:58,For this film in particular I think it unfortunately got too caught up in real world affairs. I wouldn't doubt they had a solid enough government/world affair plot until the Middle East and US governments decided to make things difficult irl. The number of reshoots happening that coincided along real world events is hard to look past lol.
Joe_Buck_Yourself_,2025-02-13 14:06:52,"It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean in reception. 1 was good, 2 and 3 were released close together with a great story, then the rest were random Jack Sparrow shenanigans.   They aren't beating a character to death, but nothing is cohesive. Why should we be hype about another unrelated story?"
Emm_withoutha_L-88,2025-02-13 15:53:21,"At the end of the day it all goes back to writing. They are either skimping out on good writers or more likely studio interference is getting in the way.   People can overlook bad CGI, the actors are usually good enough at worst and the only saving grace at best. The core issue is just bad writing."

Correct-Chemistry618,2025-02-13 18:00:57,"The problem in my opinion is in the IP factor. They (but this is true for all the big majors) have started making blockbusters by skimping on quality because they take it for granted that thanks to the IP they have, people will still go to the cinema.       This leads them to rely on a fairly stale formula for creating blockbusters (banally a generic action film that revolves around fixed stereotypes seen a thousand times, all seasoned with abundant irony) and to resort to a flat staging that is based only on the use of CGI. Anyway, they think, there's no point in making an effort if people will watch the product anyway because it features Sonic or the Red Hulk or the original Ghostbusters.      But this might have made sense before the pandemic, when people were willing to watch a film even just to spend a light evening at the cinema: now this is no longer the case, that type of entertainment is seen on platforms and people at the cinema are much more selective.      Some particularly strong IPs (Pokemon, Spiderman, Godzilla) will continue to be strong, but if producers start focusing only on those they will end up becoming stale themselves. People are excited about Sonic movies now because ""that's cool, that's exactly what I want as a game fan!"", but how many more movies can they squeeze in before the wow factor is lost? How many times can Hugh Jackman or Tobey Maguire return before audiences tire of them and are no longer distracted by the film's blandness?  Maybe it will never happen due to the modern culture based on fandoms and the internet which idolizes even the worst rubbish of twenty years ago for fanboyism, but when this IP system collapses we will really have to tremble, because what will remain is a generation of producers who do not know how to produce a captivating film, screenwriters who do not know how to construct an at least enjoyable story and directors who without an IP to put in front of a green screen will be lost and unable to bring home a decent result.      If something serious doesn't happen, Hollywood will soon become like the Italian cinema of the last thirty years: a set of projects that no one watches and made at an amateur level, with every now and then some exceptions made by a valid director who however earns little and remains an isolated case."
Area51_Spurs,2025-02-13 09:48:53,"Pandemic and writer‚Äôs strike really hurt them as well.   A big issue with Quantumania and some others was you could tell the actors were shot separately or maybe two at a time and there was way too much bad green screen.   They also were obviously rushing through a lot of the shoots.   The funny thing is The Marvels I actually thought was one of the few good ones, but it bombed bad."
MattTheSmithers,2025-02-13 20:41:43,"Feige‚Äôs ego is what happened.   He doesn‚Äôt allow the filmmakers to tell stories. He treats the directors like second unit directors, gathering establishing shots, and then cuts it all together in post. He needs to hire storytellers and let them tell stories.

misterpickles69,2025-02-13 20:14:20,The Infinity Saga had a definite end point it was working towards. It‚Äôs easier to build a characters arc when you know what the end result is. Multiply this over most of the MCU characters and we have a great series of movies. Nothing after Endgame felt like there is any common goal or enemy. It‚Äôs all just disjointed stories that are probably in the same universe. The multiverse stuff muddies the waters even further as they can change their minds at any time and keep it cannon.
Lanracie,2025-02-13 20:31:23,I think the plan for the IW Saga was a Marvel creation and at least the first half of the saga was free from Disney inlfuence.  As soon as Disney execs get involved things go down hill.
Thomjones,2025-02-13 23:06:01,"Ant Man 3 had a cool concept, it's just that Ant-Man in a fantasy world isn't as compelling.  No Way Home was good. Guardians was good. Black panther 2 wasn't bad. Many of the shows were good.  Many of the movies have been fine and I guess people don't like that. You get a couple of misses and all of sudden all of marvel is trash. Not everyone is going to be into every show. That should be acceptable but it's not.  The multiverse and stuff is a pretty vague concept and theyve been trying so hard to set it up and expand but not focus.  The only real mess was The Marvels because the whole concept was like hey wouldn't it be cool if they kept switching powers?  It's such a dumb concept and it didn't work for me."
somarir,2025-02-13 23:17:43,"(warning contains personal opinion)      While i do believe quality has gone down in general, imo it's not as bad as usually is said here. There is IMO just not an obvious ""S Tier"" movie since No way home, which we desperately need (hopes are high for F4)   **S tier:**   No way home  **The greats:**   Shang Chi, Wakanda Forever, The Marvels, Deadpool& & Wolverine   **Experimental (kinda) but still good:**   Eternals, MoM  **Slightly below expectation:**       Black widow, Quantummania  **Way Below expectation:**  Love & thunder (still a fun movie imo), Brave new world"
EchoAtlas91,2025-02-14 00:09:53,"I think that during phase 1 they were so concerned with the Infinity War/Endgame that they truly did not plan anything concrete after the fact, or if they did they did not commit/there was studio meddling."
AeroBlaze777,2025-02-14 03:26:21,"My hot take is that audience tastes have changed, and I don‚Äôt think movies like Ant Man 2 / Shazam / Aquaman would be nearly as successful if they released in today‚Äôs environment. It feels like a movie like Red One would‚Äôve been much more successful in a Pre-Covid timeline.   I think the biggest part of the equation is movie ticket prices, shit is expensive in most areas now. It‚Äôs to the point where the general audience only really goes to the theater now if they know the movie is already good."
3dios,2025-02-14 05:01:49,"The problem is neither Feige nor Marvel Studios ended the infinity saga right. Endgame was the future of what was to come from Marvel. I personally thought infinity war was great but i think reversing the entire film for ""multiverse"" basically made keeping up with all the different chapters in the infinity stone saga basically pointless. Now that time travel and multiverse was normalized it made it so anything could happen in a movie but in the end its like it never happened because \*poof\* multiverse! Just look at No Way Home. Everything you can see in a film is now at risk of not being worth anything because ""multiverse"". In my opinion Marvel studios should have ended the infinity saga after infinity war and just done a hard reboot with X-Men and F4 properties. Or even if you want to argue that the ""sopranos style"" ending would not have been commercially viable just done the hard reboot after endgame. Their other mistake is oversaturating the markets with new Marvel content every other month. Back during the Infinity saga you only got 1-2 chapters a year. Now you got a new chapter or a spin off or animated show every other month. Truly a failure on all counts for feige and co."
spicyRice-,2025-02-14 05:02:03,"I feel like somewhere back in 2020-21 Kevin F. had a big (virtual) sit down with all the writers and directors after the success of Endgame and basically said, ""forget the details, forget character development in the movies, give the people action at the theaters and we'll fill in the details with TV shows."" I just can't understand how the writing went downhill so fast without a clear directive from leadership to not worry about it."
Noah_Dunstone,2025-02-14 16:59:10,"This is true, even ant man and the wasp had personality and worked as a movie. The new films just lack any sort of personality unfortunately."
ASavageHobo,2025-02-14 19:40:32,The director choice for this film is a red flag. Why can‚Äôt we go back to endgame and before directors?
colerickle,2025-02-15 00:26:41,"I stand with Loomytime.  Accentuating that the script(s) and storyline is not thought out anymore and just not good.     I will add casting.  You have a Red Hulk character that can pop in for the next phase or 2 opening up interesting plots and you pick.... an EIGHTY TWO year old actor who hates Marvel movies?    You stick with Liv Tyler as Betty and have to de-age her face?   Look, I'm old, I'm not an agist. but I want a nice coherent 10 year run like we had before, so picking actors like a 50 something year old Blade or a 50 year old Reed Richard to START franchises is not smart.    Pick younger no name actors and lock them in 10 picture contracts like before. We don't need name actors, we need GREAT movies!!"
macs182,2025-02-15 01:32:12,"There's no Endgame in sight, so they'll script the movie without having a clear idea about what's gonna happen next, and whatever sudden change they feel it should happen they'll try to force by either editing or reshoots."
joebear174,2025-02-15 11:18:31,"I feel like I‚Äôm going fucking crazy watching these past 2 phases of MCU. Every single project has felt like they were just making shit up in the middle of making the movie. Tones, themes, writing, performances, nothing feels like it flows together at all, and I‚Äôm just talking about one specific movie at a time. It feels like every other scene is from a slightly different version of the script and they just have to waste so much time dumping bad exposition dialogue to fill the gaps they made. I really really hope Thunderbolts feels more cohesive than Brave New World. I have high hopes that F4 being somewhat isolated from the rest of the MCU that it might feel more complete, too."
Slow_Lawfulness9925,2025-02-15 23:21:44,I‚Äôve discussed this at length with my dad we‚Äôre both life long marvel fans and have seen every movie the conclusion we‚Äôve come too is after the infinity saga they thought the super hero hype would die down and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to continue much longer but when fans ended up prolonging the life span they were lost on what to do so they tried to basically start from the beginning of a whole new mcu I don‚Äôt personally think it was the best choice however just due to the lack of correlation between movies the characters and situations felt extremely disconnected but that‚Äôs also how the mcu started after watching brave new world tho I do have hope for future projects the movie not only brings in new characters in an organic and interesting ways to not only further the storyline and expand their character roster but also tied it into previous films which not only revived long forgotten characters but also expanded on their lore to bring new aspects about them overall I do think it was a pretty good movie especially considering other recent projects my only note is there‚Äôs one scene towards the end where they are on a street and you can very obviously tell they‚Äôre on a blue screen the rest of the movies effects looked great! But that‚Äôs also one scene caught my attention and was pretty bad I won‚Äôt lie
pedalspedalspedals,2025-02-18 02:11:12,"Also the way they've seemingly been shooting these movies recently: very little time is given to two or more actors being in the same room at the same time and displaying that on screen and letting them *act* together.¬†   This movie in particular, I'm not sure there's even 5 minutes total of two actors clearly working off each other instead of individually reciting lines."
No-Soil5798,2025-02-25 08:55:15,I‚Äôm glad someone is saying it
MrCatSquid,2025-02-13 14:03:27,"After Endgame, they were likely expecting a drop off in viewership, which is normal. I don‚Äôt think anyone expects the MCU to ever have a movie as big as endgame again. But the problem is, instead of taking a leap and building a new universe of new characters, they are trying to establish a stable base with the already existing characters. We‚Äôre just getting movies with the exact same characters, and new ones don‚Äôt get their own backstories or origins. It‚Äôs all tied in to another established character somehow. Hawkeye show, new captain America adjacent characters, new captain marvel adjacent characters. Their biggest success this saga was Loki, maybe Moon Knight, because they are separate from everything else. People WANT cameos, but they want it to feel good. You have to establish your character separately, and then introduce them. Otherwise it doesn‚Äôt feel like a team up or cameo, it just feels like more of what‚Äôs already there.   They just don‚Äôt have the balls anymore to try some risky characters and movies, because their incredibly beauracratic process of deciding a movie to make relies on surveys about which character is the most popular right now."
GetsThatBread,2025-02-13 14:07:03,"There was a TON of novelty when Marvel started the MCU. I do think the films have gotten worse, but not THAT much worse than some stuff we saw in phases 2 and 3. People are simply tired of superhero movies. I think we all celebrated Endgame and a lot of us said that we were good for a while. Marvel has put out movies that I‚Äôve actually enjoyed quite a bit (Shang chi, no way home, multiverse of madness, guardians 3) but nothing that has gotten me excited for this next big saga. In my opinion, they should‚Äôve used the multiverse to reset the universe. Have Dr. Strange end up stuck in another universe where Tony Stark and the Avengers never existed. Strange could‚Äôve been the new Iron Man and all of our new heroes could have existed in a vacuum. I think that would have been more interesting then trying to keep up with every plot thread of every minor character that the MCU introduced."
Mediocre-Lab3950,2025-02-14 00:58:58,"It‚Äôs because of woke. People don‚Äôt like it when you shove all this DEI stuff in superhero stuff. Black Panther wasn‚Äôt woke, it was organic (and an awesome movie). But from FAWS onwards it got very woke. If you look at the data, that‚Äôs when marvel overall started to drop off. They had outliers like Spider-Man, Loki, Guardians‚Ä¶but those weren‚Äôt woke. Every time they make something woke or DEI it fails. What a shocker, it‚Äôs almost like people don‚Äôt want to be condescendingly lectured when they watch their superheroes. People don‚Äôt want to admit it was the woke, but it‚Äôs the truth."
obilonkenobi,2025-02-14 01:05:42,From the trailers I saw I'm really looking forward to Thunderbolts. I am getting an endearing team of mishmashed outsiders who somehow coalesce vibe ala Guardians.

I plan to see it and decide for myself, as I've done for all the Marvel movies.  There are some I've absolutely loved (and critics hated), and others I've hated (and it seemed like everyone else loved).    I'm a firm believer in something Harlan Ellison used to say: ""You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your INFORMED opinion.""  Meaning, watch the movie or read the book.  Experience it for yourself.  I think that's healthy."

I do think forming your own opinions on media is important, but I understand negative reviews making you not want to spend money on something, especially in the current economy.  The thing that annoys me is people who form extremely strong opinions about things they‚Äôve never experienced for themselves, good or bad. Like the super vocal Silent Hill fans last year who were preemptively declaring the remake ruined Silent Hill 2 but had obviously never played a Silent Hill game before."

kafit-bird,2025-02-13 13:21:03,"\> The last film before the current one, D&W was a major hit, before that there was GOTG3, BPWF, SMNWY that were also well recieved.  Those were all pretty successful, yeah. What's interesting is that it's not enough. We still have this narrative where Marvel is slowly coasting downwards.  And I think it's not hard to see why.  1) Almost none of those sequels did as well as their immediate predecessors.   2) Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Deadpool all carry their own distinct brands bigger than the broad-strokes MCU (the last two weren't even *part* of the MCU until last year, and NWH was leaning on nostalgia from pre-MCU projects, too).  3) Between those successes, we had historic bombs like The Marvels and Quantumania, lukewarm disappointments like Eternals, and a ton of shitty Disney+ projects like Secret Invasion.  It's not that hits don't exist anymore.  It's that misses are becoming more and more common, they're becoming more dramatic, and the public is becoming more and more fatigued with them. Time was, the franchise could tank a Dark World, a Hulk, an Iron Man 2 and be fine because the audience was still overwhelmingly ""with"" them. Iron Man 2 was immediately at the bottom of everyone's tier list, but at the same time, no one really cared because, holy shit, the Avengers were just a couple years away. The hype was there. And I just think that's just no longer true."
Ohnorepo,2025-02-13 10:51:45,"Those early movies are given more leeway due to the early nature of the MCU. Mistakes happen when trying something different.   That mixed bag you mention was still a near constant 80% or 8/10 across the board, with the occasional outlier. Love and Thunder, Marvels and Quantumania is a string of closely released misses that Marvel has never had. That's ignoring their shaky show releases mixed in too."

BZenMojo,2025-02-13 07:34:41,"Reviews so far seem to be...  Mackie's the only thing holding any of it together.  Giancarlo Esposito shines in one sequence and then gets wasted.  Movie collapses due to a fear of being political and ends up being garbage filled with unmotivated characters.  Early action sequences are punchy and gritty, later action sequences are muddy and confused."
BZenMojo,2025-02-13 07:37:23,"That's not what's happening.  They're hiring talented people to direct beautiful movies with compelling drama, then they farm out the action to the Second Unit Directors they have on staff for every other project (unless the directors are famous enough to demand particular choreography talent), then they underpay and underproduce the movie in post-production.  They have an entire team of inexperienced junior executives with little screenwriting experience to give constant notes and demand full rewrites (this was outed during the production of Secret Invasion) while having no idea how to manage workflow of the other elements of the project.  The result is these nonsensical, often confusing scripts with grand set pieces and bombastic action constantly nipped and tucked into something inoffensive or toothless or boring or undemanding from people who don't understand how story or character works but who need to keep things on an even keel for future projects.  At this point the obsession with making characters palatable to a generic audience that isn't really interested in the story has taken over from the people who see why those stories are relevant or contemporary."
CaptHayfever,2025-02-13 07:06:40,"Cap 4 definitely isn't the breaking point, because they changed Marvel Studios' production process right *after* Cap 4 was done filming (and after the WGA/SAG strikes). Thunderbolts & F4 will be the test runs of their new process."

BLAGTIER,2025-02-13 10:14:36,"> TBH, a lot of the problems we‚Äôre seeing in these recent movies were also here pre-Endgame (shoddy CGI, rushed 3rd acts, very ‚Äúclean‚Äù looking, etc).  The content, the core emotional moments, of those movies made up for it. That's the difference in my opinion. The genre has been sky beams and action figure mashing for a long time, it can be done well or poorly(often both within the same movie), but the movie has to connect to the audience on some emotional level to succeed. Which I think the entire genre(live action comic book movies, MCU, DC and the Sony Verse) has been mostly failing at the last few years with some exceptions."
hatecopter,2025-02-13 06:43:25,There are definitely a lot of MCU movies with 70s and 80s RT scores from phase 1-3 that'd would have gotten scores in the 40s or 50s if they'd been released in 2023 or 2024.

The last 12 movies were rated better than they were except, randomly, for The Eternals and Quantumania... or the movies are being reviewed accurately and this is a bad movie?"

On the other hand Thunderbolts actually looks pretty good based off the trailers, it might look a bit derivative and unoriginal but it at least looks like they knew what themes and story they wanted to tell, that they actually had a vision and goal for the characters based off the trailers, so I‚Äôm hopeful that will be a good movie and fun blockbuster with a competent story.

However, they didn‚Äôt give the character any time for that and they gave him the most generic supporting actor in Hollywood. Anthony Mackie is great in a supporting role - especially when it‚Äôs lighthearted (see Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, or if you want him as a lead then he did OK in Twisted Metal). He‚Äôs not a leading man though, any media where he‚Äôs been cast to lead has always been meh or a complete flop.   I like the guy, as a person he seems great, it just doesn‚Äôt come across on film."
raven_klaw,2025-02-13 11:10:30,"Anthony Mackie is a great actor, but the writing for him as Captain America isn't good. They're trying to make him act like Steve Rogers while simultaneously saying that he's not Steve Rogers. When he took on the mantle of Cap, he lost the Falcon personality that fans loved. Why couldn‚Äôt they keep his original characterization while still proving he‚Äôs a worthy Captain America? Let Sam crack jokes like he did as Falcon‚Äîeven when he's bleeding or getting punched, he‚Äôd stand up, laugh it off, and keep going.

I liked the spectacle and budget they put in and really loved the final battle across realms. I am straight as they come but did not mind Chris Hemwsorth flashing his abs. Tom Hiddleston is awesome as always and it made me understood all the hype women have had for him since Avengers.  I loled at the subway blonde girl who tripped on Thor...

Soar_Dev_Official,2025-02-14 05:41:15,"great point tbh, Phase 1 and 2 were very hit or miss, and Phase 2 was, yeah, really bad. there were a lot of people questioning the MCU after AoU"
Zaumbrey,2025-02-17 03:07:11,"I think there are three big things:  \#1. Tying TV and movies together as required viewing really burnt people out. It's easy to justify sitting through two hours of Thor: The Dark World because someone said that it tied into Infinity War than to get a Disney Plus sub and sit through WandaVision because someone recommended it before Multiverse of Madness.   \#2. They rushed to start a new big bad. This might just be my big issue and I could be misreading the situation, but having two Avengers in a row be centrally focused on the saga's big bad was a huge miss. Avengers 1 just teased the big bad, Avengers 2 had nothing to do with Thanos. Meanwhile, we have multiple properties across multiple Marvel series where the big bad is a major antagonist. People have no time to settle in to a new saga. Also, Kang was simply too weird and poorly executed.   \#3. Executive meddling. It feels like Marvel movies, more than ever, are being made by committee, and my suspicions are made so much worse by the fact that Iger blamed The Marvels on executives being too hands off. Now, I can't say whether executives would have made The Marvels better, or whether Thor Love and Thunder was given too much creative freedom, but I believe wholeheartedly that executives are meddling a lot in the overarching thing.  I think MCU still has it in them - Deadpool 3, Guardians 3, and to a much lesser extent Black Panther 2 - but frankly, I almost believe that they need to pull some Flashpoint shenanigans if they want to be able to be half as successful as the Infinity Saga."
Levonorgestrelfairy1,2025-02-13 09:28:35,Yeah phase 2 was dogwater  Iron Man 3  Thor 2  The winter soldier  Age of Ulton  All of them had shit writting and editing around Ant Man 3 level.  Guardians was awesome and heavily carried this era with Thanos hype. If that move didn't exist phase 2 would be remembered as it was. Shit.
Skunk_Giant,2025-02-13 09:40:43,"Yeah this definitely does feel like the ""last chance"" for Marvel Studios. Not only do Thunderbolts and F4 have to showcase the change in production philosophy of Marvel Studios, but if they aren't excellent, there's going to be no real hype for Doomsday.    To be honest though, I also think a lot is riding on Born Again, maybe even more than F4. There's been talk for ages about Brave New World being disappointing, so I don't think anyone is too shocked at these reviews. But Born Again is something that people have been waiting years for and will be comparing to the original show. If it doesn't meet expectations, Marvel's in trouble."
Aggravating_Cry2043,2025-02-13 19:22:47,Was this the last movie after which they changed there way about marvel television movie and animation?

TheBagenius,2025-02-14 05:43:00,"I think the whole quantity over quality thing was the issue. It took 10 years to conclude the Infinity Saga, and we got maybe 2 movies a year. They are trying to do too much too fast, and it's reflected in the work quality."
tahrue,2025-02-13 10:05:33,can you link me to where this is talked about?
JoeBeck55,2025-02-13 11:16:32,"I agree. There have always been highs and lows within the MCU, but there was always that cohesion and that sense that it was building up to a huge, climactic event. Since Endgame, I don't see that. It's just all these characters being introduced with no common thread or tie in with the universe and where it's heading."
njf85,2025-02-13 14:35:32,"I know alot of people will disagree with me, especially since some of the shows are great, but I've said for awhile that the D+ shows were a mistake. They made things too hard to follow."
GatorBo69,2025-02-13 15:36:34,"Well Jonathan Majors getting fired sure didn‚Äôt help. Regardless that Quantumania was still bad, they had a clear direction they were headed that we will never know about. Hence the rewrites and reshoots for Brave New World to make it work with the new story arc.  F4 and Thunderbolts will tell us if MCU gets its swagger back or not.   They are also their own worst enemy. Had they just stopped at Endgame, the Infinity Saga would gone down as one of the most miraculous feats of jelling 23 movies together beautifully, and it still does. But this is what happens when you give a true finality to a story line.  You gotta start all over with the core group mostly gone, and make the people love the new story. That‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt happened yet with a few exceptions here and there."
PhoenixStormed,2025-02-15 00:00:18,They new they wanted kang they could have had a kang variant weaved into the background of each film somehow pulling strings or being an actual big bad all leading up to a kang war or with each  appearance offering a more dangerous kang.  But no. They wasted that concept completely. Letting a kang who defeated and killed the avengers killed by ants.  Who the hell came up w that dumbass idea. Do they even read comics and know these characters!
senn42000,2025-02-15 12:55:58,"A little like lightning in a bottle. A great overarching story, a charismatic core group of characters, played by actors that were really hitting their stride. A connected universe, which has now been done to death by a million different brands."
FrankReynoldsCPA,2025-02-14 03:25:58,"Disclaimer: I still like 90% of what the MCU is putting out, even if it's not as good as what came before.  But it's not great that we're now 2 phases into the Multiverse saga and almost nothing has really been tied together.   Very few crossovers, no ""team"" until later this year, no real clear path to Doomsday or Secret Wars.    It's like if Age of Ultron had just come out and we had no idea that all roads lead to Thanos.  The mind stone, space stone, reality stone, and power stone had already appeared at this point(though the space stone hadn't really been identified as such yet).  The second iteration of the Avengers lineup had been organized.    We've hardly seen any Avengers since Endgame.  I think the only team members we've seen share screentime since then would be Thor, Rocket, and Nebula.   Strange kind of counts I guess with his interactions with Spider-man and Wanda, even if he was never actually an Avenger.     Since 2019, we've seen Captain America in a TV show and one movie as of this weekend.    Part of it is Jonathan Majors fucking them over(as well as that arc not really being well received anyway), but part of it feels like a hubris that led them to just throw darts at the wall to get the most diverse(conceptually, not racially) set of projects that they can, feeling like they couldn't possibly fail"
JustSomebody56,2025-02-21 18:07:02,"The story was meant to be about Kang(s).  But they fumbled with that, so they are pivoting to something else, and a lot of movies suffer from this sudden change of direction"
FrankReynoldsCPA,2025-02-14 03:27:36,They really need to tighten up their writing crew and start hiring more experienced directors and writers.
Scuba9Steve,2025-02-14 01:52:53,I feel like maybe the lack of sequels within phase 4-5 is part of the issue. They all were either individual movies or single sequels to something from phase 1-3. It's easier to have forward progress when you have 3 iron man movies and 3 captain america movies and such not to mention multiple avengrrs movies. Instead phase 4-5 are stories with different characters in each and no new avenger movies yet either to tie everything together.
PhoenixStormed,2025-02-15 00:13:36,No Wandavision was excellent so was Agatha all along so was falcon and soldier which should have been a movie I would have paid to see that in a theater and the plot was so much better than brave new world.  Werewolf by night was good! The problem is they don‚Äôt have the people to create all these shows and movies and make each compelling.  The Netflix marvel shows are all good except first season of iron fist. Runaways is good. Cloak and dagger is good.  None of them made by Disney Whois evidently stretched too thin.  They should have never created Disney plus and let Netflix handle all their shows. Maybe then the albatross of Disney plus not being profitable would be irrelevant because Netflix would have paid big bucks for a corner of marvel all their own
namethatsnotused,2025-02-14 00:19:18,"Thor love and thunder was 4 hours of just random material filmed and cut and pasted together to make a plot that was supposedly cohesive.  Theres a scene that was filmed with Zeus giving Thor a heart to heart talk, seeming almost like a father figure to Thor. Compare that to how he was in the actual movie, and it makes you wonder how they had so little of the plot figured out yet still went ahead and started filming."
AgentOfSPYRAL,2025-02-13 09:47:36,"It‚Äôs amusing that for most legit movies resonating with real issues is a feature not a bug, unless you‚Äôre not actually trying to engage with real issues."
Dyssomniac,2025-02-13 13:41:21,Doing a political thriller and re-writing it out of concern for real world events has to be one of the dumber corporate safety values. The Bourne Identity series did so well because it was completely rewritten to match the post-9/11 world instead of being faithful to it's mid-Cold War roots.
BZenMojo,2025-02-13 07:29:49,"Happy cake day!  And what's funny is, Falcon and the Winter Soldier had the same problem and noticeably reworked its last one or two episodes dramatically to get around the fact that the US was, just like the GRC, hoarding medicine in a pandemic while people died by the millions.  You can't hire people who are aware of the world's political realities to write the best movie they can and then panic that they predicted that the US government is going to do bad things.  Guess Ryan Coogler is the only guy who can get away with it."

It‚Äôs going to be amazing!  Now Thunderbolts* is what I‚Äôm most excited about. It. Looks. Awesome. Like a perfect mix of action, story and humor. God, I love David Harbour as the Red Guardian, he‚Äôs fucking hysterical! üòù  Now my only question for those that have seen Cap4..  Something must happen to Bucky bc he‚Äôs a Congressman in Cap4 and in TB he has his long hair again and isn‚Äôt clean cut. He must get ousted somehow and that‚Äôs how they get him on the team.  I love Sebastian Stan, Bucky is one of my faves. I hope they don‚Äôt do him dirty.  You know Thunderbolts is gonna be good when they haven‚Äôt shown Sentry other than shadows. A good movie typically has a great trailer yet you know they are holding back something truly special.  With Cap4, you basically got it all from the trailer.  I rank Cap4 above Thor The Dark World in the list of MCU movies, which is the the best of the ‚Äúworst MCU movies‚Äù, imo"
Area51_Spurs,2025-02-14 00:09:38,You mean Avengers
Area51_Spurs,2025-02-14 00:09:10,This is estimated to make the same amount opening weekend adjusted for inflation as the original Captain America (~98 million).  That means it very likely will lose money since the reviews indicate it won‚Äôt have great legs.   And I imagine a black Captain America movie won‚Äôt make up for that internationally.   That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not great.   If Thunderbolts* loses money too that means three of the four most recent Marvel Movies lost money. Which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.   That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre paying RDJ a bajillion dollars for the new Avengers movie and going straight to Avengers after FF with Spider-Man in there too for phase 6. They need to be risk free and stack the deck.

If the film does not have the desired success, the DCU would be downsized and perhaps Gunn would be kicked out by Zaslav (not exactly a CEO friendly to the creatives), removing a dangerous competitor in whom many have faith and interest."
JuicyJ2245,2025-02-15 03:40:26,"Also want to add, some hero brands are quite literally too large to fail. Wolverine and Spider Man absolutely survive even if the MCU is dead and gone.  Captain America and Iron Man?‚Ä¶not so much.  The threshold of failure between the huge brand heroes and the others is pretty wide. You can make a garbage Spider-man movie and people will still be able to enjoy it (Amazing Spider-man, Fox X-men movies, etc.)  Make a garbage Captain America/Thor/Ant Man/ movie? Fans aren‚Äôt gonna bother showing up, and we see this happen in real time. My friend group of 12 have seen every MCU movie the weekend that it comes out.

TotallyToeSucker,2025-02-13 14:34:41,"Not hating on Captain Marvel, I personally liked it and thought it was overhated,  but it‚Äôs the perfect example of what would be the mcu‚Äôs undoing. Rotten tomatoes, IMDb, and general audience consensus agrees it‚Äôs a mid movie, but the MCU brand name was so strong and the iron was so hot it made a billion dollars. There was a point where unless the MCU made something absolutely horrible, whatever they put out was gonna succeed. So, why try? The movie is gonna make money anyway."
paintpast,2025-02-13 22:39:42,"To be fair, the whole MCU started with a movie that wasn‚Äôt ready when they started filming (Iron Man). It was working for them for some time, too.  Funny enough, too, Marvel comics in the past had this weird writing method where they drew the comic first using an outline of the story and then the writer added the dialogue and narrations later. It worked for them for a long time until they realized it didn‚Äôt. It felt like Marvel Studios was doing this with their movies.  At least they‚Äôre recognizing it doesn‚Äôt work anymore."

CaptHayfever,2025-02-14 21:53:00,"A lot of their very successful early films were shot without a finished script, most famously Iron Man 1, so it's not unreasonable for them to have thought that was a workable model. (And it's also not like they did that universally, either; Whedon & Gunn both had their scripts ready well in advance, and apparently Coogler does too considering he'd already had a BP2 draft finished before Boseman died.)"

ElephantBunny,2025-02-14 05:21:14,"Lets face it, No Way Home and Deadpool & Wolverine were carried by fan service. Thats exactly what they are doing with Avengers Doomsday and RDJ as doom. The only projects that can hold their own without resorting to fan service are thunderbolts and fantastic 4, so they have to prove themselves with those films.   Loki and Guardians 3 were amazing, but theres some things about them still. Sure, Loki's character had a great conclusion, but all of the buildup with Kang is now useless, and he was probably the only character that has had proper buildup for the upcoming avengers movies... Guardians was consistently great but now James Gunn was fired for a ridiculous reason and is head of the DCU. I personally look forward to Superman more than the MCU films rn"

YetAgain67,2025-02-13 06:40:47,"Yup. Ant-Man was the first time I felt a real sense of ""meh, not doing it for me"" with the franchise. Thor 2 also disappointed me, but it wasn't a deal breaker. It was just one film. Still, 2 films not doing it for me wasn't a deal breaker. But looking back they were the first signs I was losing interest.  Civil War was terrible imo, and when I first felt a huge rift between myself and the fanbase.  GotG Vol. 2, imo is one of the few genuine crowing jewels of the MCU to this day...and it's reception back in 2017 was very contentious..  Ragnarok and Homecoming put me off the franchise completely and that was when I knew that what I saw and what the fandom saw couldn't be more different, because, again, imo I felt that fans were looking at all the wrong things when it came to these films.  Black Panther is ALMOST worthy of its cultural impact imo - but it plays it safe with its themes and the truly careless VFX hamper it significantly.  From there it has been massively hot and cold for me with the franchise. And really, it's been mostly cold with only GotG Vol. 3 being the only post Endgame (Endgame is also terrible) project I think stands on its own as a good film. And yes, that includes the shows."

BZenMojo,2025-02-13 07:22:47,No they didn't. Look at the reviews for the last 12 MCU movies. **1/3rd of them have better reviews than Endgame. Half are better than Infinity War.**  No one is grading these movies on a curve. This subreddit just has selective amnesia. This is legitimately the 2nd worst MCU movie ever made.
Doc-Spock,2025-02-15 21:36:21,Agree completely. I definitely appreciated what they were trying with Eternals.

FomtBro,2025-02-13 06:50:46,"idk, GoTG3, Loki, and Hawkeye were all better than Ragnarok, Ant-Man 2, Civil War, or Age of Mid-Tron. I would put them in the 'pretty dece' crowd."

BZenMojo,2025-02-13 07:25:37,"Third worst. Out of 35 movies. It is in the bottom 8% of the entire MCU.  Also, a lot of people here are on some serious copium pretending the post-Endgame universe has been getting bad reviews just because they personally don't like them.  Reminder: *Of the 12 movies released since Endgame,* ***4 are better than Endgame*** ***and half are better than Infinity War.***  This movie is being reviewed on *those* terms. In a field of movies people think are generally as good or better than everything that has come before. And it still managed to be worse than anything that has come before except two other movies."
NCBaddict,2025-02-13 08:26:42,"The Marvels should honestly receive the award for this, but it def got some sympathy reviews to stick it to the ‚Äústay woke, stay broke‚Äù crowd.  I loved Captain Marvel but the sequel was unwatchable. Eternals & AM3 at least had  some cool visuals."

YoloIsNotDead,2025-02-13 07:01:01,I think we should've known when Chloe Zhao directed Eternals that a good director whose made a really good movie where they have lots of creative control will not always translate those results into a $200M blockbuster with heavy studio input.

Zaumbrey,2025-02-17 04:37:32,"I think a soft reboot is needed. There's simply too many series to keep track of. Honestly, Endgame could have been a good way to cap the series off and start anew with new series, but they didn't want to kill off series potential by killing off Ant Man Thor or Doctor Strange or Falcon or whatever. I think it could have been more interesting if we had Saga 2 not really focused on anyone or make any sequels to Phase 1 stuff. Keep it locked in on Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange, with Fantastic Four, X-Men, and Daredevil joining the fray (And stop making Ant Man movies for the love of goodness!).  Of course, I agree with you wholeheartedly that writing is the problem, but I think even good Saga 2 would be struggling with how they've been handling it, they'd just be struggling less."

Marvel keeps hiring the best talent, then hacking everything they do to pieces until it's disposable garbage. Nia DeCosta probably had the best response, ""I already shot the movie, they can do what they want with it.""

____mynameis____,2025-02-13 15:57:47,"Their OG plan for Daredevil is what that made me realise how freakin out of touch and high on money those lot were.

Seriously, I want to know what were they smoking to come up with an idea as stupid as that at a time when Marvel was already starting to struggle a bit."
jopzko,2025-02-13 09:15:26,"Honestly yeah. As we saw with a lot of previous films like Antman or Dr Strange, if directors arent willing to give up control to Marvel then they leave the project, Indie directors are much more willing to bend the knee."
davinitupoverhere,2025-02-13 07:36:18,I heard that same thing about one particularly ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù fight scene with Esposito. That‚Äôs a shame. But I did hear the Red Hulk VFX are actually very cool

The drop off in quality is back to roughly about Phase 1/2 levels. There's still plenty of new content in the MCU that's super well-liked (Far From Home, No Way Home, GOTG Vol. 3, Deadpool and Wolverine, Shang-Chi, Wakanda Forever, WandaVision, Loki, Moon Knight, GOTG Holiday Special, Werewolf by Night, etc.). It's just that there's more content coming out in a short amount of time than before so you notice the misses more.

njf85,2025-02-13 14:50:25,Yeah I think he carried it just fine. The directing was a weakness for sure. At one point I sat there and thought to myself that I wish the Russo's had stuck with the Cap movies lol
YetAgain67,2025-02-14 23:23:02,"What?   You said the film doesn't deserves the ""disastrous reviews.""   But by sheer numbers, they aren't disastrous at all.   People really need to finally learn how RT works.   With over 100 reviews on the site for the film as I type this, its sitting at 52%, which means that actually, it's reviewed positively by a slim majority. 52% of critics gave it a passing grade/good review.   The reviews are mixed. Not disastrous.   Disastrous would be like, if the aggregate percentage was in the 20s or teens."

xanderblaze123,2025-02-13 15:02:15,"Phase 2 movies were not shit, they were important for character development, phase 3 wouldn‚Äôt be as impactful if we didn‚Äôt see the characters go through changes in phase 2.  If phase 2 didn‚Äôt exist, the characters in phase 3 would be so bland.  So what if there were faults with the editing, marvel (at the time) knew how to push along the overarching narrative of thanos and the infinity stones, while developing all their characters, using comedic undertones and with a stronger focus on tragedy. Tony with his PTSD, Captain America having been betrayed by the organisation that he thought was good, Thor with the loss of his mother.  Also for the record, winter soldier was one of the better received movies by critics and fans."
Then_Twist857,2025-02-13 17:05:12,Some of those entries listed are my absolute favorite MCU entries. Agree to disagree.
Soar_Dev_Official,2025-02-14 05:45:28,"Winter Soldier was, for a long time, considered the best MCU movie. it doesn't hold up so well now, but at the time it made a huge splash. Ant-Man was also pretty well received. So in all you have  * Iron Man 3- Not loved, but not really disliked. considered better than Iron Man 2 * Thor 2- Widely disliked * Winter Soldier- Beloved classic * Guardians- Beloved classic * Age of Ultron- At the time somewhat poorly received, but in retrospect holds up better than the first Avengers * Ant Man- Forgettable but enjoyable  Which is about the same as Phase 1  * Iron Man- Beloved classic * Captain America- Well liked, but not loved * Thor- Forgettable * Hulk- Forgettable * Iron Man 2- Widely disliked * Avengers- Beloved classic, that doesn't hold up that well anymore  It really wasn't until phase 3 that the MCU hit it's stride"

Markus2822,2025-02-13 18:49:06,"I don‚Äôt understand why everyone keeps on saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs marvels last chance to get it right‚Äù they‚Äôve done that over and over and over and constantly prove themselves, back to back we just got Deadpool and Wolverine, Agatha all along and we‚Äôre currently getting an amazing Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man show. We‚Äôve gotten great projects in the past like Loki, wandavision, guardians 3 etc.   Marvel is good, and continues to prove they make good things. How many good projects do you need before you accept that?  Just because we got another eh good but not great project doesn‚Äôt mean the mcu is dying and on its last breath. Ffs the next two movies look awesome, the next show looks awesome. Does everything need to be a hit for you? Because that won‚Äôt happen. Half of phase 1 kinda blows and that was arguably the mcu‚Äôs most important time to get it right. There‚Äôs still plenty of bummers along the way like ant man and the wasp and thor the dark world, and there will be many more to come.   That‚Äôs just how the mcu is, why can‚Äôt people accept yea there‚Äôs gonna be a bad-mid project every now and then?"
Thomjones,2025-02-13 23:10:18,Really confusing. So these MOVIES have to do well or it's over for Marvel Studios? But a lot is riding on a TV SHOW?
3dios,2025-02-14 05:03:57,F4 will do fine even if it is more slop. Thunderbolts will likely bomb though. At this point the sooner they get to F4 and phase 6 the better.
Old_Focus_7920,2025-02-15 08:08:29,"Even the after credits scene lacked any excitement or anticipation, so badly done. A sign that they really don‚Äôt know what direction they‚Äôre going."

Dragonpiece,2025-02-13 11:58:52,"I mean, I think Marvel would still let Feige wrap up the universe with doomsday and secret wars, since that likely reboots the universe either way."
FrankReynoldsCPA,2025-02-14 03:17:44,"It's a business, they'll keep making their product as long as they're financially able to.   It's like saying Ford has to stop making cars now because the Fiesta was a piece of shit."

Mojave_RK,2025-02-13 14:11:45,"This right here. The MCU has felt meandering for a while. We used to get like 4-5 movies then an Avengers movie. Now, they‚Äôre intro-ing so many characters in ancillary things like streaming shows we can‚Äôt progress with the main characters because we don‚Äôt even know who the main characters are by having them all team up."
psuedophilosopher,2025-02-14 11:40:22,"I mean they did have a specific thread that was going to be where it was leading, and they had a really great villain to be the big looming threat, but then Jonathan Majors became box office poison for a while after his trial and conviction for domestic violence. That and also unfortunately the Kang in Quantumania, just like everything else in Quantumania, sucked.¬† So the entire looming Kang the Conqueror plot line had to be shredded. We were very lucky that the results of shredding that plot line was the amazing second season of Loki, so they were able to salvage some high quality content from what they had originally been building, but it left the entire rest of the MCU connected plot lines in tatters and with no cohesive direction.¬†"
bardghost_Isu,2025-02-14 22:28:43,"That also has the side effect of making it east to just not care when a film is bad.  At least during the infinity saga, if a film didn't do well, I still went to watch it because it most likely had some major event that tied into the larger background story with the stones, which had everyone hooked.  Now they have no hook that makes me want to go and watch these films, so when they are bad I can just sit it out."
Rebatsune,2025-02-14 11:51:17,"They‚Äôre comic book movies so would it be too much to ask to treat them as such? Not everything HAS to tie together after all‚Ä¶ As far as I‚Äôn concerned, this is the new status quo for MCU now."
crispyg,2025-02-13 17:48:36,"As soon as it felt like homework, they lost tons of people. I know that this community does not want to hear that because this is their deepest passion. What is rich is that they announced they were shrinking the amount of stuff released in a year, and then IMMEDIATELY rolled it back.  I want this stuff to be good, but I see the MCU becoming more akin to Bond movies or Godzilla stuff. They do well, but they'll likely never be on the very top again."
JoeHatesFanFiction,2025-02-14 04:19:49,"The D+ shows weren‚Äôt a mistake in the idea itself, but in how it was executed. It should have been extra, not essential stuff. It should have been for experimental projects and exploring weird corners of the universe that would have otherwise been ignored. You want to have a stand alone Loki show that follows a variant we saw for a second in Endgame? Fine sounds exciting. Don‚Äôt use it to introduce your phase 4 and 5 villain. Even if Majors was an angel so we could keep Kang introducing him that way is dumb. You want a show of Wanda exploring her grief, that‚Äôs an interesting place to take a super hero property. Don‚Äôt have it be essential set up for several other projects. Legitimately how many projects is Wandavision doing set up for at this point? 4 with at least vision quest still on the horizon?"
Tsweet7,2025-02-13 19:17:22,"This is absolutely my take. I'm excited about this movie, but I've already withdrawn from the Marvel Academy since She-Hulk.¬†   We shouldn't need a PhD in the MCU to enjoy these movies. As much as I've enjoyed some of the D+ content, I am just really tired of trying to keep up."
Thomjones,2025-02-13 23:16:48,"The mistake is not making some of them movies.  Because if someone doesn't have Disney, then they never saw the shows.  But with shows they get to do riskier things and do more story.  I think it would be fine if they stopped teasing. Just set up the crossover."
Bulky-Purpose9816,2025-02-14 10:44:55,If they hadn‚Äôt messed up Wanda‚Äôs story in multiverse of madness they could be doing a lot better rn. But Agatha all along rebounds that a bit but i don‚Äôt get why they just don‚Äôt go the magic route and start adding more magic things and in the other marvel movies to start pulling stories together .
Scuba9Steve,2025-02-14 01:38:48,Quantumania just had no character development for the people that actually lived there (kang didnt originate there). No real development of the location either. I feel like they did a better job with Titan in infinity war just with Thanos's monologue. All I know after a 2hr movie is that there are beings in the quantum realm that Kang ruled as a dictator. Maybe they are trying to put too many things together and make them work.
PhoenixStormed,2025-02-15 00:07:45,Phase four had hits Mom was a hit. Spidey was a hit Wakanda forever was a hit Shang chi was a hit   Wanda vision was a hit Falcon and the winter soldier was a hit Guardians special was a hit   Phase five   Deadpool and wolves a hit   Agatha all along a hit in my eyes despite being one of the lowest rated shows it was made w a tiny budget and it was excellent   They messed up brave new world by trying to smash a hulk and captain America movie together. Should have cut all things hulk out of that movie

soldiercross,2025-02-15 03:02:20,"No, it pays no attention to the fact that Wanda mentally kidnaped and mindfucked an entire town of people for months on end for her own emotional wellbeing.  Wanda is not remotely the hero and the show does not spend enough time with the fact that what she's doing is morally fucked.  It is clearly evil.  I think I could live with that line if Wanda had replied after ""it wont change what I did to them"" instead of ""it wont change how they feel about me"".  There's a lack of ownace on Wanda's part that is deeply unsettling."

I know there is hatred towards Larson ( very unfair if you ask me). But the newness and the red hot Marvel brand totally outweighs the hatred. Now we mainly have characters who have been with us for a long time, or new characters they are less important. Chang Chi should get the sequel last year.

TnebirT,2025-02-13 09:01:59,Which 4 and half are those exactly? Is this based on your personal opinion? Because it‚Äôs not based on RT rating or audience score
FindTheTruth08,2025-02-13 10:55:35,"Completely agree. I really enjoyed Quantumania and the Eternals, despite the mostly forgettable heroes, works with the mystery around the deviants/celestials. Quantumania could have had a more memorable ending had Hank suited up one last time sacrificing himself to save everyone, but I was never disappointed Ant-Man beat Kang and escaped.  The 2 movies I hate the most are Thor:L&T and the Marvels. L&T just feels like a joke if a movie and ruins everything. The Marvels on the other hand was just awful all around. MS Marvel I find the most likable but I feel like none of them are really believable. Maybe it's the CG or the director doesn't typically do action movies. I feel it's the latter but possible both."
WhenDreamandDayUnite,2025-02-15 05:50:48,"Why watch comic book movie then? There's plenty of ""realistic"" gun action blockbusters out there, which I personally do not care for. Also, more color doesn't mean ""cartoony""... Just look at Fantastic Four trailer."

esar24,2025-02-17 07:43:30,"Too many story to track of has been the essence of a comic book franchise, it is really the biggest problem in comic books itself and not the MCU that try to emulate that.  Soft reboot only be needed to bring characters that the actors has either move on or retired, there so much story to tell about Iron Man, Gamora, Steve Cap and many other characters which I believe should not stop being told just because their previous actor has moved on from said role."
esar24,2025-02-14 07:14:46,"MCU are not messed up, it is still in the sense of multiverse saga, we even got to introduce with eternity and death, a bit closer to infinity, living tribunal and TOAA introduction in the future. Nothing even close to bad lore breaking except for secret invasion while the rest are still stay in the context and story on this universe.  They rarely hire good and competent writers these days that is why you don't see any good stuff lately but if they do then it'll mage a hit like NWH, D&W and Guardians, Shang-chi is good as well.  Clean slate mean shit if they still hiring bad writers over and over again."

____mynameis____,2025-02-13 16:02:00,"Problem is GoTG 1 came at a time when the MCU brand was peaking and was becoming a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. It was a top tier movie as well as being an MCU movie made even wary people check it out, despite being totally new and unconventional set of characters. The brand helped the movie a lot.  Thunderbolts could be just as good or better than GoTG but can still be a commercial failure because of how much the MCU brand deteriorated in name."

Material_Adagio_522,2025-02-13 09:48:09,If it was Chris Evans captain America it'd be a lot worse than Mackie Captain America. General audiences still see Mackie as strictly B List and him as the lead was always going to be risky.

Vitzkyy,2025-02-13 07:28:03,I mean the only reason it looks bleak is because they fumbled the ball so much between 2021-2025 so now they have to throw a hail mary and pray it sticks  Avengers 1 worked out because the movies before it built it well and same goes for Infinity War/Endgame. Shang Chi appeared in a single movie in 2021 and that‚Äôs probably your highlight of phase 4-6 so far and you expect him to carry? So many solo project didn‚Äôt go well that the roster looks weak due to extreme lack of compelling characters and character development
Geraltpoonslayer,2025-02-13 07:57:16,The newest characters I'm most interested about shang chi is put on the bench for years now because of marvel struggles with Kang and corona

RoboZoninator91,2025-02-14 05:05:19,"It's casting against type, maybe he can do it but I've never seen him play a character like Reed"
acbadger54,2025-02-13 12:58:36,"Yes, but it was the sentiment and implication of your comment ""No one likes anything anymore, no one can just enjoy the movie""  and that it's ""tiresome"" to hear people criticise it  Well guess what they don't enjoy it because it's a mediocre production, and people are tired of of that becoming the standard quality with actually quality movies like Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and Deadpool and Wolverine (both of which were received very well and most people seem to enjoy despite apparently ""no one liking anything anymore"") becoming exceptions to their output which people are rightfully criticizing it for and that is squarely on Marvel for the current state of the MCU"
Iyo23,2025-02-13 08:03:46,Nowhere did I say monolith. Reaching as usual.   I‚Äôve seen tons of positive reviews from fans. I guess they don‚Äôt count to you guys because you only want to talk about the negative ones.
Dry-Mission-5542,2025-02-16 13:04:48,"Oh, yeah. You said that. The thing is, this isn‚Äôt even the Hulk. This is the Red Hulk. These are two separate characters. And as a major Hulk fan with the 2008 film as one of my favorite superhero films (which is a fairly unpopular opinion, as far as I‚Äôm aware) saying that this is the best Hulk since 2008 is high praise. Hulk doesn‚Äôt even show up. But I did rather enjoy this movie, all things considered. And this Hulk-esque character was handled far better than Hulk was after Avengers, at least."
SpaceCaboose,2025-02-15 21:09:09,"Iron Man was 2008.  I enjoyed all those early movies, but Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Iron Man 3, and Thor: The Dark World are nowhere near the level of Winter Soldier, Guardians 1 & 2, Civil War, Doctor Strange, Homecoming, Ragnorak, etc.  All I‚Äôm saying is that the average MCU film from 2008 to 2013 was good, but the average MCU film from 2014 to 2019 was fantastic.  They stepped up their game big time."
Levonorgestrelfairy1,2025-02-13 10:13:00,The editing is terrible.

TheBagenius,2025-02-14 06:00:29,"I'm hopeful for the future. I know a lot of people aren't and have already given up, but I still watch everything they put out, and I still enjoy every part of it, even if the writing or visuals are questionable. I usually go into every film or show with the question of ""What can I get out of this? What part of this story do I need for the greater story as a whole?"" So even if the project isn't my favorite or I just didn't resonate with it, I at least watched it for a reason. And some projects are better off not being taken at face value, so I go in to have fun, and that's all these films have ever been for me."

Singer211,2025-02-14 09:08:38,Multiverse of Madness is perhaps exhibit A for this.  I know people who did not watch WandaVision and they were baffled when in the film Wanda was suddenly a crazy murderer villain (because she very much was NOT that in Endgame which was the last film she was in.
GatorBo69,2025-02-15 13:34:15,Couldn‚Äôt agree more!!
PhoenixStormed,2025-02-17 00:07:05,That explains so much
Dyssomniac,2025-02-18 05:51:39,"> They are still spy movies.  Yeah, and the point is that spy movies - and political thrillers - have changed with the times. Something that would be considered utterly unacceptable in nearly all 1980s spy movies or political thrillers (say, the US commando working with a Soviet spy to prevent a nuclear launch) would be more common after the fall of the wall. Same with Chinese spy working with a Japanese spy in a Chinese movie today.  I meant to reply to this a while back, but the post-9/11 film world is one where ""can't trust the government"" and ""no outlandish government tech"" and ""corporations are evil"" is written into its thriller values.  The original Bourne books were very much Cold War era spy works, while the movies put a much greater emphasis on Bourne's fight against the U.S. intelligence apparatus (or really, vice versa)."
Rebatsune,2025-02-14 12:04:24,So do what Antman and Wasp did and make SF practically it‚Äôs own character?
Area51_Spurs,2025-02-14 03:49:37,X-Men movies have never done anything near what Avengers movies have done at the box office.   Deadpool and Wolverine is the only exception but that was not exactly X-Men.
Area51_Spurs,2025-02-14 00:28:48,I dunno about that.   I run a shop next to an elementary school and I almost never see any kids with Marvel stuff outside of maybe Spider-Man the past couple years.   I used to see a lot more.   I don‚Äôt think this movie is really going to be popular with kids and I don‚Äôt think it was really made for them from what I‚Äôm hearing about it.

matthew7s26,2025-02-25 07:07:12,Mackie plays his characters with a chip on his shoulder that's supposed to be endearing but he never seems to make work.

Ygomaster07,2025-02-14 10:42:15,"I didn't find it was an excuse. I felt like it was Monica's way of saying she understood the pain and grief Wanda was going through, and she understood why Wanda was unwilling at first to let to take the hex down. It never felt like an excuse, more like a recognition of the pain she felt. I don't know if Monica forgave Wanda, i don't think she did, but she does understand the why behind what she did."
Ygomaster07,2025-02-14 10:40:08,"I liked it. It felt like Monica understand the pain and grief Wanda was holding onto. Not an excuse for her actions, but understanding why she kept things going for so long."
Ygomaster07,2025-02-15 03:44:03,"I always saw it as Monica saying she understood why Wanda wanted to stay, but not condoning what she did. Doesn't the line Wanda said in response her acknowledging that she was wrong?"

If the script isn't done, then obviously nobody's checked whether the writing was good, because the writing wasn't *there to check.* It was an *extension* of what you were saying, not a separation from it."
Safe_Librarian,2025-02-13 14:52:53,"That is such a miniscule part of it. It's because Feige pioneered this shared universe and without him we would not have gotten any of this. Feige also brought us endgame.  Kathleen did not create Star Wars, she kind of lost all good will after the Sequel trilogy."

YetAgain67,2025-02-13 10:09:29,Vol. 2 is so much better in every conceivable way than Civil War it's not even a debate.   But you're an MCU stan. Good taste is not something you're familiar with.
YetAgain67,2025-02-13 10:10:07,Yes. The entire franchise needs to die.
BZenMojo,2025-02-14 00:51:04,"We've seen the DCEU lead directly to stuff like Civil War and Infinity War after Whedon insisted superheroes always do the right thing and are our modern gods and whatever the hell he was saying in Age of Ultron.  When the DCEU swerves, it drags the MCU with it. Without the DCEU saying that people die in those giant fights, Marvel wouldn't have stopped to reckon with the possibility that people die in those giant fights and how the world would see that.  I'm assuming there was no cross-pollination of Creature Commandos and Thunderbolts, so the latter will probably be a little toothless and banal. Still, Val is a product of Wakanda Forever, so there's at least a little hope we get that charismatic calculated political cruelty back."

YoloIsNotDead,2025-02-13 07:54:40,"True. That's also why the new Jurassic World seems like it took no time to make since Universal only hired the director almost exactly a year ago, and started filming 4 months later."
AdventurousRevenue60,2025-02-14 11:53:28,"You don't understand what a director actually does. That's okay. A director directs actors performance. They don't decide the story. They don't make the plans. The producer is the one who helps facilitate that. And the writer helps. A director may bring along a cinematographer they like to help get the look they want, but they aren't the ones who are deciding that either"

hycin01,2025-02-14 01:35:06,"As someone who really liked Ant-Man 1 when it came out, no, it was not that much of a hit. Most people thought it was mid. Almost no one likes The Dark World and Age of Ultron was pretty divisive. Iron Man 3 was also super divisive. The only real giant hits in Phase 2 where Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy."
j1h15233,2025-02-13 09:17:20,"I mean maybe. Maybe not. The phase 3 movies and even the Loki series helped phase 2 projects age well. I‚Äôm just saying, people forget where we came from. Phases 1 and 2 and even 3 weren‚Äôt all just bangers. They aged well with time because they tied it all in. I don‚Äôt think people are giving phases 4 and 5 that same chance.   On the other side, some of these projects have been worse than most of phase 1 and 2. I‚Äôm just saying let‚Äôs see how they age."

YetAgain67,2025-02-14 23:16:05,"As much as I am disenfranchised with the MCU and my tone is often derisive of it, I'm not necessarily rooting against it; I just don't have any faith in it. That was sealed with the lackluster, drab bluish-gray FF trailer.  FF was the only MCU project for the foreseeable future I had any passing curiosity and hope for because of how long they've been after it and all of the waffling about really doing it justice.  I watched the trailer with a genuinely open mind...and it looks like more of the same imo. Just with the shield of the retro-futuristic aesthetic protected it from less discernable fans. Imo. There is no excuse for a film they've been trying to make for years and years to look so generic and bland.  No shade to anyone who thinks FF looks good, but I'm just not seeing it.  Vol. 3 is the only genuine Win of the studio in years imo. And I have a soft spot for Multiverse of Madness purely because it's a rather simple 2hr superhero movie that Raimi was allowed to bring his flair to and that has a somewhat unique arc for its hero for a late-stage MCU film. I couldn't care less about the fanboyish reasons people hate MoM. To me it's one of the only MCU films with personality in ages.  Other than that...  Hell, I don't even like a lot of the older films I used to love. I've soured on the entire franchise with a few exceptions here and there.  The only films I still find stand up on their own are the GotG trilogy, Captain America 1, Iron Man 3, and to a lesser extent Thor 1, Doctor Strange 2, and Black Panther. Oh, and Homecoming. I think it's a thematically confused mess, but its charm and strong performances win me over.  The first Iron Man feels...icky to me today...what with an armored billionaire going to the Middle East to literally blow up brown people.  Some things just don't age well. And depending on the person those things can be overlooked, and sometimes they can't. Lord knows I defend tons of films accused of being ""problematic"" today. But we all have our own outlooks. And for me in this moment in time Iron Man 1 just doesn't sit well with me.  The first Iron Man was still made during America's infatuation with insane jingoism and hatred towards the Middle East post-9/11. And with everything going on in the world right now in regards to the Middle East, America's involvement in it, and power tripping narcissistic billionaires, the film simply, well you get the point.  I can already hear the protests. ""But the terrorists are the 10 Rings! They aren't meant to be analogous to real world Middle Eastern terrorists!""  But like, they are? Cuz they're in the Middle East? And the leader seen in the film is Middle Eastern? And Tony is kidnapped and help in the Middle East? And that arm of the 10 Rings is terrorizing Middle Eastern people?  Yea, it's just...gross. Not shaming anyone who can look past it or doesn't see it that way, but for me? Yeesh.  For me personally, I honestly think the only thing that could get me back into it is a total reset. Which I doubt is happening anytime soon.  The MCU experiment has run its course."
grandmofftalkin,2025-02-13 23:07:40,Making 3x it's budget is a hit sorry the facts don't line up to your argument
a_dumb_pumpkin,2025-02-13 09:53:54,"Yeah, definitely a pattern there"
hycin01,2025-02-25 06:17:53,"Multiverse of Madness also has an 85% yet a lot of people vocally don't like it. Even the Marvels has an audience score of 80%, Quantumania has an 81%, and Eternals has a 77%. Phase 4 and 5 have pretty comparable audience scores to Phase 1 and 2."

Sad-Ebb8843,2025-02-13 14:08:10,"No. You don‚Äôt get to decide my implication and insert your own interpretation into my words.   Fan favorites stand out, of course, people see Deadpool & Wolverine and Guardians as good movies. So it wouldn‚Äôt matter what the reviews said. This film was fighting an uphill battle before it was announced. In today‚Äôs climate, it didn‚Äôt stand a chance."
qhndvyao382347mbfds3,2025-02-13 08:20:10,"And yet you're also acting like critics are ""slamming"" a Marvel movie, when for every negative review there is a positive review. I guess those critics' reviews don't count to you, you'd rather perpetuate some notion that critics as a whole are untrustworthy or somehow ""different"" from fan reviews"
Peyote42O,2025-02-21 20:04:29,Ya they were still better than anything else. I actually like the Thor movies. There was also The First Avengers in 2012 and Captain America First Avenger. We'll probably never see this again where we get 15 or 20 movies over 10+ years that are all great and different and combine to tell a story
KH_Nakama,2025-02-13 11:24:19,"A few minor nitpicks does not a downturn movie make.   Also I'd argue, and always do, that iron man 3 is severely under rated, age of ultron is at worst just good. Thor 2 is thor 2, that one I can't defend.   But phase 2 was still consistently producing good movies, way above the caliber of recent MCU."
souledgar,2025-02-13 22:53:45,"Despite minor continuity and logic hiccups, you‚Äôll find that most people name Winter Soldier as one of the best MCU films. Most films do."
Soar_Dev_Official,2025-02-15 00:29:16,"the first 2/3rds of Avengers are pretty boring and forgettable. while Loki becomes an interesting, well-rounded character later in the franchise, in this movie, he's very cookie-cutter and his plan is cliche'd. most of the character interactions between the Avengers boil down to ego clashing, which can be fun for brief stints but gets old very quickly without the novelty of seeing them together on screen. It all feels pointless, just the bare minimum necessary to get us to the Chittauri invasion- which is still phenomenal, no notes there.  Compared to AoU, Ultron is a much more interesting villain, his plot is better, and his relationship with Iron Man is richer than Thor and Loki's. The interactions between the various Avengers are more layered and nuanced too. I'm not saying AoU is a great movie, to be clear. The finale lacks the raw thrill and tight choreography of the first movie, and it feels absolutely stuffed to the gills- setting up Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Zemo, Wakanda, Vision, and I'm sure more that I'm forgetting. But the movie as a whole has more meat on it's bones than it's predecessor, so I prefer it as a standalone experience."
FrankReynoldsCPA,2025-02-14 03:12:21,"I mean, Fox and Sony were doing consistently worse.  Marvel produced Phases 1-3.  Fox and Sony never had that."

GatorBo69,2025-02-15 14:33:02,"Just saw Captain America tonight and it was, imo, the MCU getting back on track. It wasn‚Äôt great, it wasn‚Äôt bad, the best way I can compare it to other MCU movies is that it wasn‚Äôt bad better than Thor The Dark World, which is at the top of the worst ranked MCU movies.  That‚Äôs me setting aside my love for the MCU and being as objective as I can.  It had its moments, my wife who isn‚Äôt a MCU dork like me but has seen every MCU movie once enjoyed it.  It had a good core plot with Sterns at the center of it, it was a bit muddled with a few too many sub plots as well, but Anthony Mackie did a great job as being worthy of carrying the shield.  Also, finally ‚ÄúCelestial Island‚Äù was a focal point and I thought it was a creative way to introduce adamantium.  Cap‚Äôs suit was badass, and the struggle of him not taking the serum is what makes him a great Cap. With his Vibranium suit he is very powerful and it‚Äôs not just about the abilities he can do in the suit, it‚Äôs his mastery over it that makes him great. Just as Torres was a great example that having great tech doesn‚Äôt automatically make you great.  I predict this is the year of the return of the MCU. Fantastic Four WILL be great, anyone who thinks otherwise, please screenshot this and call me out later if you disagree when you see it. It‚Äôs a passion project for Feige and it will be epic.  And then there‚Äôs the Thunderbolts*, which I think will be the best of all 3. From what I saw of the new trailer, it looks like a badass fun filled ride. The only thing that will have to be answered is what happens to Bucky. He‚Äôs a Congressman in ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù with his act together. Now he could still be that Congressman but he‚Äôs let his hair grow back out so something must happen to him. Unless he simply does this on the side.  Regardless, Cap 4 was above average, and I think of the beginning of the resurgence of the MCU. Every movie can‚Äôt be knocked out of the park and after Endgame they simultaneously accomplished an amazing feat of having a true ending to an epic saga that NO other studio will ever duplicate. On the other hand they basically had to start all over.  It‚Äôs like Alabama having Nick Saban and being dominate, then he leaves and they slump, but they will eventually return to prominence.  Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a good analogy or not, but that‚Äôs the best I got! lol.   All I know is this year has some great movies that I‚Äôm pumped about. Superman, Jurassic Park and one of my most anticipated movies, Mission Impossible Final Reckoning, which I truly believe Ethan Hunt will die in this last film. Mission Impossible will continue, but just like 007, they‚Äôll find a suitable replacement. But dang, he looks like he‚Äôs running a true marathon in. This one as opposed to his normal mile or two. üòù"

Not to mention the amount of slop they had released on the sonyverse.  This is why I hope DCU succceed, because it is currently handlr by gunn and it could give the sense of fightng that MCU once had.

FreeLook93,2025-02-15 00:00:03,Listing Gunn's and Whedon's movies is a bit misleading. They were allowed more control because their films came a lot earlier and set the tone for the MCU going forward. The rest of the movies you mentioned fit the already established mould.   If you think they don't need to supervise the correct directors look into Edgar Wright's experience on Ant Man. Or what Sam Raimi has said about his time working on Dr. Strange. It shows that even if given more creative freedom the production line these movies are made on greatly limits the directors ability for self expression.

On the part of which movies are good, i thought deadpool and wolverine was a diamond in the rough. Some of the boomer humor was cringe like the ""woke mob"" and ""canceled"" jokes. But all around, it's better than most of the stuff that they released at the time. I'd also like a reboot after whatever avengers movies they make. I feel like they didn't really think past endgame and rushed all these legacy characters out the door as a result. Now that they own the xmen and such i think they could easily do something more cohesive a second time around."

This implies the criticism, BNW and the MCU as a whole is unwarranted and inaccurate and therefore people shouldn't be expressing it  ""No one likes anything anymore No one can just enjoy the movie"" no plenty of people love plenty of stuff post endgame again people loved Guardians 3, no way home, deadpool and wolverine, Shang-Chi ect so you boiling down any criticism to just ""people just will always complain and can't enjoy movies"" is inaccurate and incredibly dismissive of criticism and there ""fan favorite"" BECAUSE they're some of the best things to come out of the MCU especially post endgame  ""Everything has to be the best thing they‚Äôve ever seen."" Nope but it still needs to be quality, which the MCU has started to struggle with more and more within recent years  ""Inb4 ‚Äúactually I liked Brave New World‚Äù in a couple months, like they‚Äôve done for every other negatively reviewed MCU film."" Yep, people will still enjoy it (almost EVERY film will have its enjoyers) and, those types of posts are going to attract OTHER people who also enjoyed it but it doesn't make the initial criticisms inaccurate or unwarranted or represent the majority opinion of audiences or the fandom just the people who respond to the post  So no I didn't ""decide your implication and insert my own interpretation into your words"" you said it and I rephrased it that's what happened you acted like the anger and disappointment with the MCU is uncalled for when the dissatisfaction with the MCU has grown because of poorer and poorer productions, which have led to shit like eternals, secret invasion, Quantumania, She-Hulk, etc and now possibly BNW the criticism is genuine and deserved because it's becoming far too frequent to ignore  Are people saying BNW is an unwatchable piece of shit? No, but it's mediocre, and there's been WAY too much of that in the MCU in recent years to repeatedly excuse it and it's reasonable to expect better at this point"

YetAgain67,2025-02-14 23:57:50,"I think that overall, the MCU gimmick just couldn't sustain itself.  The MCU is now 34 films deep. That's more films than decades and decades old franchises like 007 and Godzilla. And in just a few months time it will be 36 films deep.  That's one more film than the Japanese Godzilla franchise. And if we count the American Godzilla films and the MCU shows, the MCU STILL beats Godzilla in glut of content.  It took the Toho Godzilla series over 70 years to reach 33 films. And those films aren't all interconnected like Marvel. The MCU exceeded 33 films in less than 20 years. Add the TV shows in the mix and it's. Just. Too. Much.  You can't treat cinema like TV indefinitely and still have it work for you.  Fans who are still onboard will defend the model until their dying day, and that's fine. But for people who aren't chest deep in it, it's just a chore now. And they will just pick and choose what they want to watch for the foreseeable future instead of treating it like appointment cinema like they did during the franchise heights of Phase 3.  I don't think the MCU is dead. But it is *dying*. It's future success is now contingent on nostalgia like D&W. The upcoming Avengers film will do huge numbers, obviously. But the ""solo"" outings will see less and less engagement. It's already started.  The studio can't count on the films being carried by goodwill alone anymore. More Ant-Man 3s, Eternals, and The Marvels are going to happen."
boringpotatochipbag,2025-02-13 12:01:09,"Those are completely minor nitpicks. The laziest form of film criticism is the CinemaSins style approach of tiny nitpicks.  Why engage with the movie in earnest when you can say ""movie bad because not enough rock fall on superhero.""   Give me a break."

ali94127,2025-02-14 07:39:59,"You're acting like Marvel Studios didn't also make Winter Soldier, GotG 1-3, Black Panther, etc. Or that Fox and Sony have made some of the worst Marvel movies ever like Daredevil, Fant4stic, and Madame Web."

laughland,2025-02-16 22:37:40,"Exactly, as much as everyone says the directors don‚Äôt have any control (which they don‚Äôt) there is also a shocking lack of oversight from Marvel brass as well to make the movies and shows have the connective tissue to make it feel like a cohesive whole.

If she wasn't suggesting that it was either great or heroic, then the statement starts to lose its impact, right?   If Monica said ""the people you enslaved will never understand the [small] sacrifice you made,"" then the scene doesn't play nearly the same way, right?"

hycin01,2025-02-14 01:40:21,"Agreed with people kinda overrating the perception of Phase 2, but Doctor Strange 1 was pretty close to universally well-loved. Some people criticized Kaecilius, but liked the movie a lot overall. Guardians 2 is pretty much split between people who think it's one of the best MCU movies ever or people who think it's one of the worst, so I'll definitely give that to you. Phase 3 still easily had the most beloved movies out of the entire MCU, though, and people forget that Phase 1 and 2 had to build up that hype and there were plenty of misses and mid movies."

Levonorgestrelfairy1,2025-02-13 12:11:44,Again. Not minor nitpicking. They are total breakdowns in the plot of the film.  Nothing i have seen in phase 4 has been that bad.  I might not have like the direction certain films took but there been no writting/editing as bad as the phase 2 stuff when the films have no internal consistency.

Ohnorepo,2025-02-13 11:22:45,"> The release rate in phases 4 and 5 has been less than in phase 3  11 projects in 3 years for phase 3.   15 for phase 4, if we count what could have been the pre covid schedule, also 3 years. Add in two specials for 17.   15 for phase 5, also 3 years.   Either way both points are correct. Quality has dropped, and the release schedule is at fault too. They're kind of the same problem though. The release schedule putting all the pressure on post production has been awful and their visual effects departments have struggled to keep up."

MemoryLaps,2025-02-15 02:56:11,"Typically ""sacrifice"" is tied to situations or things where you had a ""right"" to do something and you chose to voluntarily give up.¬†   For example, if I save a bunch of money for a new car then decide to give it to someone else to pay for a surgery they need, it might be fair to call that a ""sacrifice.""¬†   On the other hand, if I rob someone to get the money for the car but then return it when I find out they need a surgery, other reasonable people aren't going to look at that as a sacrifice on my part.¬†   Obviously giving up her kids is different than giving up the car. However, it doesn't change the fact that she only got the kids by enslaving the town. She had no right to do that in the first place so her decision to stop wouldn't typically been seen as a ""sacrifice.""   Calling out a sacrifice implies that the decision to enslave everyone was somehow acceptable or reasonable or open to rational disagreement.¬†"

Obviously it was wrong and fucked up to do that to a town, but she still ended up losing her husband and kids. And she unknowingly caused this before learning about it(at which point she should have taken down the hex).    It's a very grey area for me.

Ygomaster07,2025-02-15 16:07:53,"That's a good point. I always interpreted it as her accepting what she had done and that's why she isolates herself, because she feels guilt about what she did. And Monica knowing Wanda is in pain. I appreciate you having a civil discussion with me on this."
