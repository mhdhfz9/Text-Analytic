Like even if Thunderbolts, F4FS, Doomsday, Spider-Man 4, and Secret Wars are critical hits, I fear the damage has been done. So much of the Multiverse Saga has had mixed or poor reception, that they have done material damage to the reputation of the MCU. That’s my fear. They’ve pissed away all of the goodwill from the general audience. Like it took actual effort to do that. It’s an impressive feat. Sad, but impressive. And you know what, it is so hard to reclaim and fix your reputation once you’ve damaged it. It takes years to build up, and seconds to piss it all away. \n",

I’m also angry and sad for Mackie. \n",

      "I’ll withhold full judgment until I see it tomorrow, but these critic reviews are unacceptable for a studio that had 9 whole extra months, including a strike, to get this right. 48% is just straight up unacceptable, and it falls squarely on Kevin Feige’s lap. The pandemic was 5 years ago. Bob Chapek was ousted in late 2022 and filming for Brave New World didn’t start until 2023. Can’t blame the pandemic or Chapek anymore. Feige hired Julius Onah. Feige hired the writing team. I get that Feige has been generally revered amongst fans of the MCU. I mean, shit, me too. But I’m concerned that Feige has, and to borrow a football analogy, become Bill Belichick without Tom Brady. You can blame Secret Invasion, AMW- Quantumania, Love and Thunder on the pandemic and Chapek. But this you can’t. This is Kevin Feige’s fault, and this is the first time I find myself seriously questioning Kevin Feige’s ability as a producer. He’s had a great run, but sometimes people just lose their touch, and that’s what truly scares me as a fan. It may be time to have that conversation.\n",

      "I suspect they cut alot of Sabra's scenes out. You get a brief glimpse of her in her white-blue suit (albeit under a coat) prior to the Celestial Island battle, but then she doesn't make an appearance or fight in it. That's all you see of it. I can't imagine why they'd make the suit but then not even show her in it properly so I'm assuming scenes got cut.\n",

      "Celestial Island battle was awesome (dunno what was with Cap surfing a missile though lol). And I also loved that there were a few jabs about Sam's counselling past throughout but then later when it's clear Red Hulk is too strong, Sam falls back on counselling the guy down. I feel like that will divide some people but I liked it. Sam played to his strengths. He acknowledges he should have taken the serum because physically he can't compete.

Mackie has a decent comedic presence, so idk why they leaned away from it. There’s a lot of older Marvel movie stuff mentioned, that should have been mentioned before now. It felt like too much of it either should have been just dropped or referenced in some way in the last couple years. This one had “do your MCU homework” before watching, which has been a huge issue for the MCU. I think if it just picked a lane and stayed in it, it might have been a decent film, but instead they just chose to drive all over the road with it\n",

Without spoilers (though if you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the spoilers), the best way to sum it up is they took the idea for a filler episode from a potential falcon and the winter soldier season 2 and made it a two hour movie. I genuinely dont know how much longer Marvel can keep putting out below average movies before people just stop seeing them. If thunderbolts ends up being a stinker, then we need to start asking the people running the show the hard questions. I know personally if thunderbolts is bad, then I'm done. I'm tired of waiting for some magical thing that's going to fix these films. \"Just wait for the xmen bro\" \" just wait, they're gonna come back with the next Avengers, bro,\" Feigie needs to pray that thunderbolts knocks it out of the park.\n",

People. GO FORM YOUR OWN OPINION ON THE MOVIE. I love Marvel. I have grown up with these movies since I was in first grade and I’ll be honest, I have lost faith in them over time, especially after endgame, especially these past four years. I’ve liked/loved some of their projects the last few years, and I’ve also disliked some as well. I’ve had plenty of issues with MOM, L&T, Quantumania, the Marvels, I could keep going. \n",

      "This movie was honestly amazing. I think GOTG vol 3 for the record has been marvels best film since endgame, I would put this right below it. The action, the performances were great. SAMUEL STERNS AS THE VILLAIN?!? Dude was so creepy and awesome. It’s a true back to form marvel movie. So much good pay off and references from past projects while also setting up what’s to come. It was great. I was so skeptical going into it and I can honestly say the negative reviews are a bunch of bs. There’s maybe one scene you can tell that was reshot but that doesn’t bring the movie down at all imo. I can’t say enough good things about the movie, it didn’t feel rushed it accomplished what it needed to do. I could see myself seeing this again in the theatre. Don’t wait for Disney+ or pirate it, get some popcorn and friends and go see it. My theatre was loving the movie too people laughing and cheering at the best stuff. It felt like the old days.

Excellent villain, 17 years in the making.  \n",

      "From a cinematography perspective, I was impressed. It was very stylized. A lot of thought was put into composing each shot, making even slow dialogue laden scenes interesting to look at. Big scenes felt big and exhilarating. Very 80's in its neon red and blue lighting which aided in the tone of high stakes  global and political tensions . good use of shadows.

The dog fight over the ocean looked so much better than the final battle from black panther 2. This feel like progress.\n",

Harrison Ford was absolutely brilliant, and played Ross very well - literally nothing to complain about. I wish we had more Hulk scenes like the end battle in other films. Seeing Ford’s Red Hulk jump over to the monument was Eric Bana like. Please Kevin, please. Let Hulk be Hulk again.\n",

      "Sterns pulling the strings was the stronger part of the plot obviously but it seems like it won’t get acknowledged as such because of how much people don’t like The Incredible Hulk.

It also felt like a lot of his later scenes were added during reshoots though.\n",

      "Overall I thought it was pretty fun/enjoyable (even if the villain is a near 20-year-old-easter egg reference - woof), but my only real gripe was the fact they spent wayyyy too much time focusing on Ross/Ford’s character and not enough on Sam/Mackie’s. The villain is played sympathetically which is fine but he gets multiple ‘deep down I really want ___’ scenes and that’s more time that should’ve been spent on Sam. Sam never really gets his ‘I want’ song aside from ‘I want to help my friend,’ and ‘I (occasionally) consider how much better I might’ve been with the serum*,’ - which could’ve been tightened with another pass at the script to solidify what the main thesis of what he was after was. \n",

The plot was confusing, felt like a hulk sequel and a captain America sequel all in one hut done so poorly. Harrison ford didn’t look like he wanted to be there the whole time he was on screen.

      "Content: I just came from my 3D IMAX, it's not bad, i was sufficiently entertained 👍. (note that I avoided anything spoilery about this film other than the first trailer drop). I'm not gonna compare this to Steve Rogers Captain America films because that's a different character's journey, this is Sam Wilson's. I will compare this to the Disney+ Falcon and the Winter Soldier though -- and I gotta say I liked that series a lot better than this one. that didn't have too much boardroom editing (other than avoiding the coincidental bio weapon thing of 2020), but with Brave New World...good grief the editing and scrubbing out and massive course correcting was really obvious 👀. they rewrote this thing several times, reshot this thing several times AND IT SHOWED 🤦. I do like the augmentation of Sam's Captain America with Wakandan tech, I always felt that Sam's CA was to Batman the way Steve's CA was to Superman. and that was what I was REALLY looking forward to for MCU's stories for Sam Wilson CA-- the more Batman-y type hero because we already saw Rogers' Superman-y version from Phase 1-3. but instead they keep bringing up Sam's skin color and largely hamstring'd his Cap to that 🤦 . it's very frustrating because there's SO MUCH MORE to Sam Wilson as Captain America than just his skin color ferchrisakes 🤦. anyways, I don't know what else they got planned for Sam's Cap, I feel it's just one mistep after another, it's like they don't know what to do with his character after Falcon and the Winter Soldier. I really do like Anthony Mackie as Cap, I really like Red Hulk and Harrison Ford, I liked that they brought back The Leader, heck I was thrilled when Liv Tyler decided to actually show up and reprise her role. it's a 7/10 for me, and again I really, really want them to bring back Sam Wilson as Cap, he deserves much more stories to tell as a more human-level Cap  (without having to rehash over and over the lamentations of his skin color geezus).\n",

On the other hand they basically had to start all over.\n",

Mission Impossible will continue, but just like 007, they’ll find a suitable replacement. But dang, he looks like he’s running a true marathon in. This one as opposed to his normal mile or two. 😝\n",

Deadpool & Wolverine 78%, MoM 74%, Thor 77%, Captain America 80%, GOTG 3 82%. the first antman is rated higher than all of those at 83% and antman and the wasp (87%) is rated higher than infinity war (85%). I think we can all agree that infinity war is not a worse movie than antman 2. review scores are meaningless when some movies have 2000 critic reviews and others have 50. Review scores are meaningless when a 5/10 is considered “unwatchable slop” but it is literally the definition of MID. Middling, median, average. 50% of people liked the movie, 50% didn’t like it making it exactly that. Average. Mid. People saying it’s amazing are disingenuous, people saying it’s dogshit are being disingenuous. People can say it a million times, I have yet to think marvel has made a completely unwatchable movie. The quality has dropped but people genuinely see a movie with mid reviews and act like it’s a 1/10 piece of shit that should never have been made.\n",

What this movie seems to do is focus on multiple stories that don't connect to anything that is related to captain america as a character like focusing on Harrison Ford as hulk for far too long, different materials that are more about black panther than captain america, us and Japan diplomatic relations. These plot points in the story don't add to anything about Captain America's ideals like in the previous movies that explore what his beliefs are about a specific topic like government surveillance, loyalty to friendship over the government, regulations on superheroes etc. If you're going to write a superhero story about one character than have that main character be the focus of the story instead of chopping everything into different stories that seem like filler rather than a cohesive story. Make the new captain america learn how to both be himself but also understand the morals of his predecessor like what happened with miles morales in the spider verse series than the movie would be far better.\n",

Most of the time though it boils down to bad writing and/or writing from too many parties (mainly the studios intervening and clashing with the original vision). This whole thing is unfortunately a carry-over from Bob Chapek’s time at Disney, when he greenlit too many Marvel projects - not inspired by any particular stories, but their propensity to make money. Feige and co are still recovering from that era.\n",

There's nothing the MCU is \"building to\" anymore. Doomsday and Secret Wars are on the horizon and will be big, but they just feel like standalone future movies at this point. The stories feel tired, because in one way or another it's always been done before...and I mean it's been done before previously in the MCU, not in the history of filmmaking.

I feel like a lot of people just want to hold on to their member berries and forget that the MCU was in a WAY worse position than they are now, but that could be because there is a lot more eyes on the MCU and just overall movie goers becoming cynical. I think the best example would be the Iron Man series. A lot of people like to look on it favorably but if it came out today the later 2 films would be considered “mid” (Iron Man 2 and 3 weren’t considered great movies in any aspect except effects and box office) and with how hostile movie audiences are I’m not sure how well  Iron Man 1 does.\n",

Haven't seen the movie yet, but tbf, it did go through a ton of rewrites and reshoots because of current events that probably messed the film up. They also had their original plan and release timeline messed up because of Covid and probably rushed things out too fast to make up for it and took on more projects at once than they should've. Though I'd say the shows have mostly been pretty good overall and just a lot of times have kinda mid finales (not caught up on the Phase 5 ones, though, tbf).\n",

      "  \n",
      "This leads them to rely on a fairly stale formula for creating blockbusters (banally a generic action film that revolves around fixed stereotypes seen a thousand times, all seasoned with abundant irony) and to resort to a flat staging that is based only on the use of CGI. Anyway, they think, there's no point in making an effort if people will watch the product anyway because it features Sonic or the Red Hulk or the original Ghostbusters.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "But this might have made sense before the pandemic, when people were willing to watch a film even just to spend a light evening at the cinema: now this is no longer the case, that type of entertainment is seen on platforms and people at the cinema are much more selective.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Some particularly strong IPs (Pokemon, Spiderman, Godzilla) will continue to be strong, but if producers start focusing only on those they will end up becoming stale themselves. People are excited about Sonic movies now because \"that's cool, that's exactly what I want as a game fan!\", but how many more movies can they squeeze in before the wow factor is lost? How many times can Hugh Jackman or Tobey Maguire return before audiences tire of them and are no longer distracted by the film's blandness?\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it will never happen due to the modern culture based on fandoms and the internet which idolizes even the worst rubbish of twenty years ago for fanboyism, but when this IP system collapses we will really have to tremble, because what will remain is a generation of producers who do not know how to produce a captivating film, screenwriters who do not know how to construct an at least enjoyable story and directors who without an IP to put in front of a green screen will be lost and unable to bring home a decent result.  \n",

      "Content: The problem is neither Feige nor Marvel Studios ended the infinity saga right. Endgame was the future of what was to come from Marvel. I personally thought infinity war was great but i think reversing the entire film for \"multiverse\" basically made keeping up with all the different chapters in the infinity stone saga basically pointless. Now that time travel and multiverse was normalized it made it so anything could happen in a movie but in the end its like it never happened because \\*poof\\* multiverse! Just look at No Way Home. Everything you can see in a film is now at risk of not being worth anything because \"multiverse\". In my opinion Marvel studios should have ended the infinity saga after infinity war and just done a hard reboot with X-Men and F4 properties. Or even if you want to argue that the \"sopranos style\" ending would not have been commercially viable just done the hard reboot after endgame. Their other mistake is oversaturating the markets with new Marvel content every other month. Back during the Infinity saga you only got 1-2 chapters a year. Now you got a new chapter or a spin off or animated show every other month. Truly a failure on all counts for feige and co.\n",

Tones, themes, writing, performances, nothing feels like it flows together at all, and I’m just talking about one specific movie at a time. It feels like every other scene is from a slightly different version of the script and they just have to waste so much time dumping bad exposition dialogue to fill the gaps they made. I really really hope Thunderbolts feels more cohesive than Brave New World. I have high hopes that F4 being somewhat isolated from the rest of the MCU that it might feel more complete, too.\n",

But the problem is, instead of taking a leap and building a new universe of new characters, they are trying to establish a stable base with the already existing characters. We’re just getting movies with the exact same characters, and new ones don’t get their own backstories or origins. It’s all tied in to another established character somehow. Hawkeye show, new captain America adjacent characters, new captain marvel adjacent characters. Their biggest success this saga was Loki, maybe Moon Knight, because they are separate from everything else. People WANT cameos, but they want it to feel good. You have to establish your character separately, and then introduce them. Otherwise it doesn’t feel like a team up or cameo, it just feels like more of what’s already there. \n",

People are simply tired of superhero movies. I think we all celebrated Endgame and a lot of us said that we were good for a while. Marvel has put out movies that I’ve actually enjoyed quite a bit (Shang chi, no way home, multiverse of madness, guardians 3) but nothing that has gotten me excited for this next big saga. In my opinion, they should’ve used the multiverse to reset the universe. Have Dr. Strange end up stuck in another universe where Tony Stark and the Avengers never existed. Strange could’ve been the new Iron Man and all of our new heroes could have existed in a vacuum. I think that would have been more interesting then trying to keep up with every plot thread of every minor character that the MCU introduced.\n",

The genre has been sky beams and action figure mashing for a long time, it can be done well or poorly(often both within the same movie), but the movie has to connect to the audience on some emotional level to succeed. Which I think the entire genre(live action comic book movies, MCU, DC and the Sony Verse) has been mostly failing at the last few years with some exceptions.\n",

Why couldn’t they keep his original characterization while still proving he’s a worthy Captain America? Let Sam crack jokes like he did as Falcon—even when he's bleeding or getting punched, he’d stand up, laugh it off, and keep going.

I liked the spectacle and budget they put in and really loved the final battle across realms. I am straight as they come but did not mind Chris Hemwsorth flashing his abs. Tom Hiddleston is awesome as always and it made me understood all the hype women have had for him since Avengers.  I loled at the subway blonde girl who tripped on Thor...

      "\n",
      "\\#1. Tying TV and movies together as required viewing really burnt people out. It's easy to justify sitting through two hours of Thor: The Dark World because someone said that it tied into Infinity War than to get a Disney Plus sub and sit through WandaVision because someone recommended it before Multiverse of Madness.  \n",
      "\\#2. They rushed to start a new big bad. This might just be my big issue and I could be misreading the situation, but having two Avengers in a row be centrally focused on the saga's big bad was a huge miss. Avengers 1 just teased the big bad, Avengers 2 had nothing to do with Thanos. Meanwhile, we have multiple properties across multiple Marvel series where the big bad is a major antagonist. People have no time to settle in to a new saga. Also, Kang was simply too weird and poorly executed.  \n",
      "\\#3. Executive meddling. It feels like Marvel movies, more than ever, are being made by committee, and my suspicions are made so much worse by the fact that Iger blamed The Marvels on executives being too hands off. Now, I can't say whether executives would have made The Marvels better, or whether Thor Love and Thunder was given too much creative freedom, but I believe wholeheartedly that executives are meddling a lot in the overarching thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think MCU still has it in them - Deadpool 3, Guardians 3, and to a much lesser extent Black Panther 2 - but frankly, I almost believe that they need to pull some Flashpoint shenanigans if they want to be able to be half as successful as the Infinity Saga.\n",

It's easier to have forward progress when you have 3 iron man movies and 3 captain america movies and such not to mention multiple avengrrs movies. Instead phase 4-5 are stories with different characters in each and no new avenger movies yet either to tie everything together.\n",

Guardians was consistently great but now James Gunn was fired for a ridiculous reason and is head of the DCU. I personally look forward to Superman more than the MCU films rn\n",

I think it could have been more interesting if we had Saga 2 not really focused on anyone or make any sequels to Phase 1 stuff.

The drop off in quality is back to roughly about Phase 1/2 levels. There's still plenty of new content in the MCU that's super well-liked (Far From Home, No Way Home, GOTG Vol. 3, Deadpool and Wolverine, Shang-Chi, Wakanda Forever, WandaVision, Loki, Moon Knight, GOTG Holiday Special, Werewolf by Night, etc.).

It should have been for experimental projects and exploring weird corners of the universe that would have otherwise been ignored. You want to have a stand alone Loki show that follows a variant we saw for a second in Endgame? Fine sounds exciting. Don’t use it to introduce your phase 4 and 5 villain. Even if Majors was an angel so we could keep Kang introducing him that way is dumb. You want a show of Wanda exploring her grief, that’s an interesting place to take a super hero property. Don’t have it be essential set up for several other projects. Legitimately how many projects is Wandavision doing set up for at this point? 4 with at least vision quest still on the horizon?\n",

And I have a soft spot for Multiverse of Madness purely because it's a rather simple 2hr superhero movie that Raimi was allowed to bring his flair to and that has a somewhat unique arc for its hero for a late-stage MCU film.

It all feels pointless, just the bare minimum necessary to get us to the Chittauri invasion- which is still phenomenal, no notes there.\n",

      "Compared to AoU, Ultron is a much more interesting villain, his plot is better, and his relationship with Iron Man is richer than Thor and Loki's. The interactions between the various Avengers are more layered and nuanced too. I'm not saying AoU is a great movie, to be clear. The finale lacks the raw thrill and tight choreography of the first movie, and it feels absolutely stuffed to the gills- setting up Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Zemo, Wakanda, Vision, and I'm sure more that I'm forgetting. But the movie as a whole has more meat on it's bones than it's predecessor, so I prefer it as a standalone experience.\n",

      "Content: I actually agree with you 100%. Especially on the ironman part. It's a good movie and I'll always appreciate it but man some parts of it haven't aged great. On the part of which movies are good, i thought deadpool and wolverine was a diamond in the rough. Some of the boomer humor was cringe like the \"woke mob\" and \"canceled\" jokes. But all around, it's better than most of the stuff that they released at the time. I'd also like a reboot after whatever avengers movies they make. I feel like they didn't really think past endgame and rushed all these legacy characters out the door as a result. Now that they own the xmen and such i think they could easily do something more cohesive a second time around.\n",

      "\"No one likes anything anymore No one can just enjoy the movie\" no plenty of people love plenty of stuff post endgame again people loved Guardians 3, no way home, deadpool and wolverine, Shang-Chi ect so you boiling down any criticism to just \"people just will always complain and can't enjoy movies\" is inaccurate and incredibly dismissive of criticism and there \"fan favorite\" BECAUSE they're some of the best things to come out of the MCU especially post endgame\n",

      "So no I didn't \"decide your implication and insert my own interpretation into your words\" you said it and I rephrased it that's what happened you acted like the anger and disappointment with the MCU is uncalled for when the dissatisfaction with the MCU has grown because of poorer and poorer productions, which have led to shit like eternals, secret invasion, Quantumania, She-Hulk, etc and now possibly BNW the criticism is genuine and deserved because it's becoming far too frequent to ignore\n",
      "\n",
